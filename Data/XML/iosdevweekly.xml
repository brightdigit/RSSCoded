        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>I didn‚Äôt know quite how to feel as I watched <a href="https://cur.at/mjs0Kr9?m=rss">Kieran Senior</a> talk about <a href="https://cur.at/IfL4uAK?m=rss">reviewing code and dealing with pull requests inside Xcode</a> this week. At first, I was nothing but impressed when I realised Xcode now integrates with both GitHub and BitBucket pull requests natively inside Xcode. I want to review code this way! The web-based representation of a pull request on GitHub is good, but it‚Äôll never compete with looking code in Xcode.</p>

<p>So, I opened up <a href="https://cur.at/fzRszYK?m=rss">a project</a> in Xcode 13, and sure enough, my active pull requests with comments, approvals, and everything else are all available. It‚Äôs a great implementation, and I‚Äôd love to send my congratulations to everyone involved.</p>

<p>Yet, I also realised I would probably never use the feature again after testing it. üò∞ If you‚Äôre anything like me, source control isn‚Äôt just for files edited by Xcode. I interact with git in every project I work on, and Xcode is only the best tool for Swift projects. If I need a standalone tool to work with git, I don‚Äôt want to learn the one inside Xcode as well, no matter how good it is. I only have limited brainpower, and I‚Äôm can only master one source control tool.</p>

<p>This is the dilemma of building an IDE vs a set of standalone tools, and knowing where to draw the line is tricky. Do I want my debugger as part of my IDE? Definitely. Do I want my interface layout tool in the IDE? Again, you probably do. Do I want source control? For me, it‚Äôs a no, and I‚Äôd guess I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs a balancing act, and Xcode has been heading towards integrated IDE and away from being a <a href="https://cur.at/1DVKwct?m=rss">collection of standalone tools</a> for a long time.</p>

<p>If Apple had made this a standalone tool that worked well with Xcode rather than as a part of it, would it have pulled me away from my <a href="https://cur.at/SHgpa8M?m=rss">source code control tool of choice</a>? Maybe!</p>

<p>I think we can all agree it‚Äôs a well-implemented feature, but I can see how things happened this way. Making a whole new tool is a much bigger decision than enhancing a feature in an existing product. A new tool needs a new team, and that team has to justify its existence. They wouldn‚Äôt try and sell a tool like this, so why make it? Yes, maybe it would bring people who didn‚Äôt do native development to their developer tool, but it‚Äôs far from a straightforward decision.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/YZxC1Tt?m=rss">The WWDC21 Developer Survey</a></h4>
        <p>What did you think of this year's WWDC? But, more importantly, how do you think Apple should operate next year's conference? Online only? In-person? Apple is asking your opinions, so this is your chance to be heard.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This survey has already been available for almost a week, so I'm unsure how long it will remain open. Fill it in quickly to make sure you get your say about the future of WWDC.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/SFn4Hz6?m=rss">The Unofficial WWDC21 Lounge Archive</a></h4>
        <p>It's not surprising that Apple closed down the WWDC digital lounges once the conference was over, but it would have been a shame to lose the invaluable information shared in them during the week. However, thanks to <a href="https://cur.at/uM0S30V?m=rss">Paul Williamson</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/EZ4BY8q?m=rss">Emin</a>, we have an anonymised archive of conversations in the lounges.</p>

<p>From everything I heard and saw, these lounges were a great success. I hope they continue next year, even if there is also an in-person event.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/99bvcqj?m=rss">How to document your project with DocC</a></h4>
        <p>Who was expecting a new Markdown-based documentation tool from Apple this year? üéâ It's a great tool, and here's <a href="https://cur.at/fcrK4s7?m=rss">Paul Hudson</a> with a breakdown of the essential information you need to know about it.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/99bvcqj?m=rss">hackingwithswift.com</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/bKv6oDG?m=rss">Hosting DocC Archives</a></h4>
        <p>Talking of DocC, what do you do with the documentation for your framework or library once you've built it locally? <a href="https://cur.at/Wnb6x5o?m=rss">Joseph Duffy</a> investigates four ways to serve your documentation as a static site. üëç</p>

      <h3>Code</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/f4RRwe?m=rss">The importance of cooperative cancellation</a></h4>
        <p>I'm assuming that everyone here has read between one and ten posts on async/await or Actors this week, so I'm not going to link to any posts on that topic. Instead, I'll link to this fascinating article on cooperative cancellation of asynchronous tasks from <a href="https://cur.at/vrcOHLl?m=rss">Alejandro Martinez</a>. You really should read this one.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/bDGd22y?m=rss">New approach to formatters in iOS 15</a></h4>
        <p>Everyone put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care about creating singleton date formatter instances anymore! üòÇ But the new formatters in iOS 15 don't just solve <em>that</em> problem. There are so many new formatters, so let's learn about them with <a href="https://cur.at/rBjexH1?m=rss">Filip Nemecek</a>. My personal favourite is <a href="https://cur.at/6EyFN41?m=rss"><code>ByteCountFormatter</code></a>. I've seen so many bad implementations of that over the years. üöÄ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/FYfsNxg?m=rss">Behind the Scenes of SwiftUI List Bindings</a></h4>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://cur.at/BntBHdU?m=rss">Peter Friese</a> looking at the enhancements to List in this year's release. It's not just a cursory glance at what's new, though. It's a deeper look at how it all works. I enjoyed reading this. Thanks, Peter! üëç</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/l6yBaYE?m=rss">Signature and Tortoise Localisation</a></h4>
        <p>Yes, this should really be an "And finally...", but that was already taken for this week. I couldn't handle not linking to this tweet from <a href="https://cur.at/YTVZLGQ?m=rss">Morten Just</a>, though. Amazing! üòç</p>

        <p>A/B testing would have been a huge step forward on its own, but with Custom Product Pages, this is a massive year for your App Store listing. Here's a fantastic rundown of what changed from <a href="https://cur.at/CvwxkKE?m=rss">Ariel Michaeli</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever get to see anything I had worked on in a WWDC session presentation. That‚Äôs a privilege even if you work inside Apple. It‚Äôs pretty much unheard of if you don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>And yet, this week, it happened. ü§Ø</p>

<p>It began when I started receiving messages and DMs from people saying, ‚ÄúDid you just see the mention of a package index on that slide?‚Äù during the Platforms State of the Union. I hadn‚Äôt even seen it, but a <a href="https://cur.at/LQvx1xb?m=rss">quick screenshot proved it</a>! I did wonder for a few seconds whether we might be about to be Sherlocked, but something far more exciting was on the table.</p>

<p>It came in the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new in Swift‚Äù session on Tuesday. 2m45s into the session, <a href="https://cur.at/psN0QRm?m=rss">Nicole Jacque</a> begins talking about Swift Packages, and suddenly, there‚Äôs a <a href="https://cur.at/8ZLLHzg?m=rss">screenshot of the package index</a>! Right there in a WWDC session! I couldn‚Äôt quite believe it.</p>

<p>I want to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who was involved in making this happen. I have to think this decision wasn‚Äôt taken lightly, and it‚Äôs so lovely to see that people inside Apple think what we‚Äôre working on is important enough to include alongside their own work. The <a href="https://cur.at/uCSUTsU?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a> remains the most exciting part of my work every week, and I can‚Äôt wait to see where we take it over the next year.</p>

<p>So, that was my highlight of this week, but that was far from the only exciting thing that happened! As usual, I‚Äôm not going to try and cover every announcement or new API today. We have several months for that!</p>

<p>I hope you all had a great WWDC week, and enjoy the collection of links below, as always!</p>

      <h3>News</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/1mwf0rP?m=rss">New technologies from WWDC 2021</a></h4>
        <p>I love this! Apple has put together a page on the documentation site highlighting all the new APIs and technology that debuted this week. The page links to both specific articles/APIs like <a href="https://cur.at/ycohZpw?m=rss"><code>TimelineView</code></a> and <a href="https://cur.at/EQPEC2C?m=rss"><code>AsyncImage</code></a>, and topic pages like <a href="https://cur.at/rBoqL1v?m=rss">this one on concurrency</a> or <a href="https://cur.at/4HBfG1l?m=rss">this one covering the new DocC tool</a>. I'm so happy to see an easy way to keep up with the documentation that accompanies a new release, and I hope we see more of this!</p>

<p>Also, there's now an official <a href="https://cur.at/JOvbrt4?m=rss">sample code index</a> for all WWDC 2021 sample code! üòç</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/1mwf0rP?m=rss">apple.com</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/UdIkgLp?m=rss">App Store Review Guidelines Updates for WWDC 2021</a></h4>
        <p>Apple also <a href="https://cur.at/tol6uU?m=rss">summarised</a> of these changes, but I prefer this "diff" style version better. The most significant change by far this year is this addition to 5.1.1:</p>

<blockquote><p>If your app supports account creation, you must also offer account deletion within the app.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that probably affects more than 50% of apps on the store! No one can argue it's a bad rule, though.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/BfzP7EE?m=rss">Package Collections on the Swift Package Index</a></h4>
        <p>Package collections are new in Swift 5.5 and Xcode 13, and the <a href="https://cur.at/X26qYf3?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a> supports them right now! We knew they were coming in Swift 5.5, so we started implementing them. What we didn't know was that Xcode 13 would also include support for them! We've <a href="https://cur.at/icUCXWC?m=rss">updated our documentation</a> to now include instructions for both the command-line tool and Xcode 13. üöÄ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/Q1JGT1l?m=rss">A love letter to Xcode 13 in five short video clips</a></h4>
        <p>Yes, <a href="https://cur.at/2vHY9cv?m=rss">Paul Hudson</a> covered this topic in much more detail <a href="https://cur.at/IReTKDz?m=rss">in a blog post</a>, but I like these short videos too. My favourite features are automatic import with automatic searching of package collections and code completion of unwrapping optional values. üöÄ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/MYLxmnS?m=rss">Vimpocalypse Now</a></h4>
        <p>Vim bindings in Xcode 13? You read that right! It's been a very long time since I used <code>vim</code> regularly. In fact, it was so long ago it was called <code>vi</code>! Could I re-learn it and for Xcode 13? Absolutely. Will I? Probably not. It's great news for people who still use it day-to-day, and there are many of those people still around. Here's <a href="https://cur.at/zcRHjcD?m=rss">Erica Sadun</a> with the details.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/PJmkLiT?m=rss">SwiftUI 2021 in Numbers</a></h4>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://cur.at/TwW90zp?m=rss">Javier Nigro</a> with a great way to get an overview of which parts of SwiftUI received the most love in the last 12 months. Things are looking up for macOS by the look of things!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/MgzrxzN?m=rss">The Future of Combine</a></h4>
        <p>One of the biggest topics of conversation this week has been what happens to Combine now that we have <code>AsyncSequence</code> and <code>AsyncStream</code> on the way? I liked <a href="https://cur.at/1qadyTh?m=rss">Ben Scheirman</a>'s take on it. What I'd say is that even if Combine is deprecated next year, which is <em>far</em> from certain, it'll likely be a long deprecation cycle. There's no need at all to refactor any working code just yet!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/lG5L07v?m=rss">Big improvements to UIButton in iOS 15</a></h4>
        <p>Who had "Huge changes to <code>UIButton</code>" on their WWDC bingo card? I know I didn't! Here's <a href="https://cur.at/yKdByfC?m=rss">Filip Nƒõmeƒçek</a> with the low down on what's changed. I'll be happy to see some standardisation come back to button design with these changes.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/f045gDT?m=rss">Notable UIKit Additions in iOS 15</a></h4>
        <p>Let's continue in UIKit land for one more article. Here's <a href="https://cur.at/qv0YJPS?m=rss">Jordan Morgan</a> with some of the framework changes that are <em>not</em> related to buttons! I'm very happy to see Apple finally provide a standard way to make a "bottom sheet". üöÄ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/X2pqVEM?m=rss">AsyncImage in SwiftUI</a></h4>
        <p>Since the earliest days of iOS development, we've been writing code to download and display remote images in our apps. It's probably about time there was a standard way to do it, and here it is in the form of a SwiftUI view. Here's <a href="https://cur.at/xCU0iim?m=rss">Gabriel Theodoropoulos</a> to tell us more. üéâ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/YCwZeja?m=rss">Updated Human Interface Guidelines</a></h4>
        <p>It's always worth re-reading the HIG after a new release, and this year is no different. Here's Apple's guide to what sections have been added or received significant updates to help guide you through it.</p>

        <p>I'm sure I'm not alone in only getting the chance to watch a few WWDC videos this week, but one I did want to highlight was this session from <a href="https://cur.at/OwJo3M5?m=rss">Matt Ricketson</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/dQIeglJ?m=rss">Luca Bernardi</a>, and <a href="https://cur.at/FHTrpvN?m=rss">Raj Ramamurthy</a>. If you've ever wondered how SwiftUI decides when to re-build or re-use views, this session does a great job of explaining it, and much more!</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>It‚Äôs almost WWDC time! üöÄüòçüéâ</p>

<p>Looking around Twitter and the web this week, I see two very different narratives from the community about this year‚Äôs conference. On the one hand, I see the usual excitement, anticipation, and <a href="https://cur.at/tDKWDMO?m=rss">hope for Xcode to be better at understanding Swift</a>. On the other, I see more unrest and frustration in the Apple developer community than I‚Äôve ever seen before. <a href="https://cur.at/kuTWVKR?m=rss">This post from Marco Arment</a> is a good summary of how many people feel.</p>

<p>I think some of you are hoping for an App Store focused announcement at the conference. Maybe all of this pressure from lawsuits, anti-trust investigations, and the community will force Apple‚Äôs hand, and they‚Äôll relent on some aspect of the App Store?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen. First, I don‚Äôt think now is the right time for Apple to make <em>any</em> drastic business changes to the App Store. The Apple/Epic trial may be over, but the verdict is still weeks or months away and making changes now would send all sorts of awkward messages.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs more than that, though. I don‚Äôt think this is fixed by ‚Äúsimply‚Äù making more changes to the App Store. This level of unrest doesn‚Äôt go away with another tweak to the percentages or by enabling side-loading. As Marco says in his article, this is much more about how Apple treats third party developers generally.</p>

<p>To be clear, I‚Äôm talking about Apple as an entity here, not about individual employees. In my experience, Apple employees are genuine, kind, empathetic individuals who care deeply about developers. Unfortunately, as a company, it can feel very different.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no quick fix for this and no single announcement that makes it go away. If Apple wants their relationship with developers to improve, it‚Äôll take consistent change over time, starting close to the top. It‚Äôs not just about the App Store terms and conditions.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a shame because we‚Äôre in the midst of so much tremendously exciting technical work from the company, and it‚Äôs partly overshadowed. I‚Äôd much rather be talking about that!</p>

        <p>MacStadium, the developer cloud for Mac, has partnered with the creator of PCoIP¬Æ technology, Teradici, to enable high-performance remote access for Mac use cases, including automating CI/CD pipelines, improving testing, and bringing Mac desktops to wherever they're needed.

      <h3>WWDC</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>So what‚Äôs your plan for the conference? Over and above what we had from Apple last year, there‚Äôs also <a href="https://cur.at/UYTrpHi?m=rss">virtual lounges</a>, but that‚Äôs only covering the official side of things. The community side is just as exciting!</p>

<p><a href="https://cur.at/CnneYiK?m=rss">WWDC.community</a> is back and bigger than ever this year. There‚Äôs so much going on there, you really must <a href="https://cur.at/CnneYiK?m=rss">check it out</a>. There‚Äôs also <a href="https://cur.at/W5Gj4uQ?m=rss">WWDC Together</a>, the <a href="https://cur.at/uF46bFA?m=rss">AltConf Keynote stream</a>, and the <a href="https://cur.at/wRAP1Y4?m=rss">Ray Wenderlich WWDC Livecast</a>  for live streams and chat. There are also a few networking events throughout the week. Some <a href="https://cur.at/4Yp544?m=rss">organised by the Diversity in Swift team</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/csXbcVB?m=rss">try! Swift DUB DUB</a>, and the <a href="https://cur.at/10Kf6E?m=rss">NSScreencast Remote Happy Hour</a>. Then, why not finish up the week in style at the <a href="https://cur.at/b79sxCZ?m=rss">iOS Dev Happy Hour</a>? There should be something to fit every preference and every timezone!</p>

<p>But we‚Äôre all here to learn as well, right? So if you‚Äôre looking for notes, the <a href="https://cur.at/nq4tznv?m=rss">WWDC notes</a> site is back for 2021, as is the <a href="https://cur.at/9KCT0d8?m=rss">WWDC Community: Learning and sharing</a> repository where you can contribute throughout the week.</p>

<p>Finally, and some might say most importantly, no WWDC would be complete without <a href="https://cur.at/6aN7avh?m=rss">James Dempsey and the Breakpoints</a>!</p>

<p>Have a great conference, everyone! I‚Äôll be back with a round-up next Friday, as usual.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/7CWNrXT?m=rss">SimpleAnalytics</a></h4>
        <p>The ultimate way to know what's happening to the analytics data from your app is to host it yourself, and SimpleAnalytics from <a href="https://cur.at/MzXh99p?m=rss">Dennis Birch</a> looks like a nice tool that'll help you do exactly that. It's a framework for your app, a <a href="https://cur.at/BvN1yjm?m=rss">~160 line server-side PHP file</a>, and a <a href="https://cur.at/U9DOrTI?m=rss">newly released macOS app</a> for looking at the data.</p>

      <h3>Code</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/go8Y0r0?m=rss">CodeEditorView</a></h4>
        <p>Maybe it's because I've been involved with a few developer tools over the years, but I often find myself needing a quick code editor. It's often not the entire point of an app you're working on, but entering code into a plain text field always feels so wrong! Here's <a href="https://cur.at/87X4lMB?m=rss">Manuel Chakravarty</a> to help with a code editor usable from both macOS and iOS (with slightly reduced functionality)! This looks great. üöÄ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/gWzJ7ov?m=rss">Why Should You Care about Manual Testing?</a></h4>
        <p>Oh my gosh, yes! üòç I loved every word of this article by <a href="https://cur.at/PLACm3N?m=rss">Tom√°≈° ≈†ur√≠n</a>. Automatic testing is hugely important, but it can make you feel overly safe and protected from errors that might be blindingly obvious when you (or someone else) runs your app.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/2YbgLxr?m=rss">NukeUI and LazyImage</a></h4>
        <p>I've <a href="https://cur.at/KV0BCSL?m=rss">linked to Nuke</a> in the past, and now <a href="https://cur.at/3BbF0am?m=rss">Alex Grebenyuk</a> is following it up <a href="https://cur.at/YnyGjZI?m=rss">with a UI library</a>. You might think that a control called <code>LazyImage</code> would be <em>only</em> about images, but it also supports videos!

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>I still (just about! üë¥) remember the first time I came across asynchronous programming. I assumed, incorrectly, that when I called into the concurrent code, execution would continue in my calling function after it had completed. Of course, I was as wrong then as I often am now!</p>

<p>I feel like programming languages are finally catching up with my naive expectations as async/await syntax becomes more standard across a wide range of languages. The great news is, that group of languages will <a href="https://cur.at/f4MUMDW?m=rss">soon include Swift</a>.</p>

<p>I started thinking about this topic after reading <a href="https://cur.at/uYPNjbV?m=rss">Alejandro Martinez</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://cur.at/DJLkQ0h?m=rss">post on Swift concurrency</a> and watching the three videos that accompany it. He covers three distinct parts of the Swift concurrency story in detail, and I learned a lot from watching them. I‚Äôm sure you will too.</p>

<p>Over the years, I feel like I‚Äôve seen programming languages fight a constant battle against complexity as the hardware, operating systems, and user expectations push languages and frameworks to evolve. As the battle progresses, complexity goes through advances and retreats and for every step forward that languages make, there‚Äôs complexity lying in wait trying to gain new footholds.</p>

<p>For example, manual memory management was a huge advance for the complexity army until the combined forces of reference counting, garbage collection, and eventually, automatic reference counting pushed it to retreat. It advanced again as asynchronous programming became something we all had to deal with until languages struck back with threads, queues, promises, and eventually async and await. There are more examples, of course, but those are two big ones. It happens over and over again.</p>

<p>I feel like complexity has been increasing quite consistently in Swift over the last few years, so I‚Äôm pleased to see the language make a decisive strike against it with some of the language changes carried by the Swift 5.5 cavalry! ü¶Ñ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/2SRRS4U?m=rss">New Apple Developer Forums features now available</a></h4>
        <p>Remember when we were all wondering how WWDC labs were going to work last year, and Apple <a href="https://cur.at/YlRcrI2?m=rss">surprised us</a> the week before the conference with brand new developer forums?</p>

<p>It got plenty of criticism when it launched, but I urged everyone to give Apple plenty of slack (no pun intended!) while giving the new forum a chance. Well, here we are just one short year later üôÑ with updates. I <a href="https://cur.at/hBUU6RC?m=rss">agree with everything that Michael Tsai say about the RSS feeds</a>, and while the updates are a step in the right direction, these forums aren't significantly different from what we had before, and what we had before wasn't great.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/OKzdmMw?m=rss">Unexpectedly</a></h4>
        <p>This new <a href="https://cur.at/YF5MMnX?m=rss">open-source</a> app from <a href="https://cur.at/7LEvoUL?m=rss">St√©phane Sudre</a> isn't related to iOS development, but I bet plenty of you will still appreciate it.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/QNk2BXr?m=rss">What&#39;s new in Swift 5.5?</a></h4>
        <p>Unless Apple is planning something drastic, we're just over one week away from the next version of Swift being shipped in an Xcode beta! So here's <a href="https://cur.at/o9e5KIr?m=rss">Paul Hudson</a> with his regular look at what's coming new.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/QNk2BXr?m=rss">hackingwithswift.com</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/aZwVNdY?m=rss">Here is what SwiftData will be‚Ä¶</a></h4>
        <p>That's a bold title from <a href="https://cur.at/JzAZLb3?m=rss">Drew McCormack</a>! A new "SwiftUI style" persistence framework is the most common prediction/wish for this year's conference that I see. I agree that it's not going to be, and shouldn't be, a <em>completely</em> new thing from the ground up. There's no need, and data persistence frameworks take years to mature. What will it be, though? Read on for Drew's take on it, including some interesting thoughts on data persistence and blockchain.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> That's the <a href="https://cur.at/3yp6CIp?m=rss">first mention of blockchain <em>ever</em></a> in this newsletter. I'm not sure how I feel about that. üò¨</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/aZwVNdY?m=rss">medium.com</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/YWmjydV?m=rss">Adding a Gradient to Large Title Text in SwiftUI or UIKit</a></h4>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://cur.at/4V5WxQW?m=rss">Becky Hansmeyer</a> with a great piece on creating beautiful gradient-masked navigation bar titles. The article is summed up perfectly by these sentences:</p>

<blockquote><p>The good news is that SwiftUI makes it trivially easy to create gradients and mask them in a variety of ways. The bad news is that SwiftUI can‚Äôt do much of anything when it comes to customizing the navigation bar.</p></blockquote>

<p>Large masked gradient titles might not be trivial in SwiftUI right now, but they are possible, and there's a playground attached to this post that proves it!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/atId4zO?m=rss">Core Data In Memory Store</a></h4>
        <p>You might be aware that Core Data supports in-memory data stores but wondered why you'd use them. If that sounds like you, <a href="https://cur.at/n5QJ0Y1?m=rss">Keith Harrison</a> has just the post for you as he covers how to create them and two interesting use cases.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/KhZ0CcR?m=rss">AASA File Identifiers</a></h4>
        <p>We recently struggled with AASA while trying to make the <a href="https://cur.at/PNEkuLE?m=rss">SPI Playgrounds app</a> respond to URLs. Documentation is sparse and spread over multiple WWDC videos, and we eventually decided not to implement it. So, I read this story from <a href="https://cur.at/jKWlr7I?m=rss">Michael Amundsen</a> with interest. I don't think the bug he ran across was the same problem we were having, but it might the same issue you face in the future!</p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/oekllwd?m=rss">Should you use gamification techniques in your app?</a></h4>
        <p>Getting gamification right in apps can be tricky. Go too far, and people could feel manipulated, but get it right, and it can work wonders for engagement. I liked this article from <a href="https://cur.at/QZ3xxG4?m=rss">Nick Babich</a>, especially the section where he talks about "achievements", or more accurately showing meaningful progress inside your app. Just be cautious with it!</p>

      <h3>Videos</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/KI4vlhn?m=rss">NSSpain 2020 - Remote Edition Videos</a></h4>
        <p>It's been a rough year for conferences, but that didn't stop <a href="https://cur.at/3tYKizm?m=rss">NSSpain</a>! As always, they've been kind enough to release the videos online. With almost 30 videos available, you're sure to find plenty to consume your weekend!</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I <a href="https://cur.at/MmiJnON?m=rss">apologised</a> for talking about the <a href="https://cur.at/40OCWtf?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a> too much. After the newsletter went out, someone replied via email saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>Keep talking about the Swift Package Index! I only visited it for the first time after this newsletter.</p></blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs a great reminder that if you‚Äôre trying to promote something, you almost certainly need to talk about it more than you think you do. I had got to the point where in my mind, I needed to apologise for mentioning it so often but still had not persuaded someone who was engaged enough to reply to my email to check it out. It blew my mind a bit! ü§Ø</p>

<p>So, the lesson is that you need to talk more about what you‚Äôre doing, right? Promote, promote, promote! There are always chances to reach someone new, right? Well, yes, and also no. When I manage to reach someone new, it‚Äôll likely be the final straw for someone else, and they‚Äôll stop listening forever. It‚Äôs a balancing act.</p>

<p>I used to think about this in quite a transactional way. For every tweet or link about someone else, I gave myself a partial credit for some self-promotion. I never went as far as writing it down or making it formal, but I‚Äôd keep a rough track in my head and try not to go into debt. I now think about it in a slightly less structured way, though, as I‚Äôve got better at it.</p>

<p>Part of why I permit myself to talk about my projects is that this newsletter has always highlighted other people‚Äôs work. That‚Äôs one way I try and balance it, but even with that, over saturating the message is something I think about all the time.</p>

<p>Another part of it is that the index is an <a href="https://cur.at/qCbXpkP?m=rss">open-source project</a>. I‚Äôm not talking about something that will cost you any money. I‚Äôd deduct much more from my credit balance if I were selling something.</p>

<p>Do you think about this in the same way? Even if you‚Äôre not promoting an app or a service, you‚Äôre probably promoting something! Maybe a side project, or perhaps just yourself!</p>

<p>Oh, and would you look at that. I accidentally talked about the <a href="https://cur.at/40OCWtf?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a> again. Deduct the credit from my balance, please! üòÇ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/vY6IOpX?m=rss">Leveraging Info.plist based certificate pinning on iOS and making up for its shortcomings</a></h4>
        <p>Apple recently introduced a way to configure certificate pinning through the Info.plist file, making it easier to tighten your app‚Äôs TLS communication security. However, it is not sufficient on its own. <a href="https://cur.at/azQyeLB?m=rss">Read Guardsquare‚Äôs blog post</a> to find out how it can be bypassed and how to increase your app‚Äôs security.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/auliPKN?m=rss">Software updates designed for people with disabilities</a></h4>
        <p>It was <a href="https://cur.at/AXlidk5?m=rss">Global Accessibility Awareness Day</a> yesterday, and Apple chose the occasion to highlight some upcoming features designed to make life easier for people with disabilities. They're all impressive features, but the one that blew me away was the AssistiveTouch for Apple Watch. Just incredible. üòç</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/g5MVzwJ?m=rss">Recreating the App Gallery</a></h4>
        <p>I'm going to do a full round-up of WWDC related links next week, but this one needs a bit of prep work, so you need to act now! <a href="https://cur.at/I5TW4gr?m=rss">Michie</a>, the organiser of the <a href="https://cur.at/oVqxwBY?m=rss">WWDC Community</a> events, had the idea to re-create the "wall of apps" from various WWDC events over the years. If you write a small or independent app, make sure you submit it!</p>

<p>My favourite "wall of apps" they ever did at WWDC was the one where they lined up a hundred or so iPad 1 devices so that <a href="https://cur.at/AyEtBw?m=rss">apps scrolled from one end of this huge table to the other</a>. Touching them caused a ripple effect to spread outwards, even onto other iPads. It was great! üöÄ</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/9K74xmO?m=rss">Permanent and Temporary Tabs in Xcode</a></h4>
        <p>There was much grumbling about the double-decker tabs introduced with Xcode 12. While some people got on with them, a larger (or more vocal?) group <a href="https://cur.at/Eo8M2P1?m=rss">found options to disable them</a>. I always found Xcode's original tabs a little awkward to use as they also changed the inspector panels, so the new tabs fit my workflow well, and I ignore the "old" tabs. However, if you're still struggling to get to grips with them, this post from <a href="https://cur.at/Aar7G6?m=rss">Leonardo Maia Pugliese</a> is here to help.</p>

      <h3>Code</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/DcTLsPD?m=rss">SwiftUI Introspect</a></h4>
        <p>I hadn't come across <a href="https://cur.at/XmPewzj?m=rss">Lo√Øs Di Qual</a>'s <a href="https://cur.at/wcikWnZ?m=rss">Introspect</a> library before reading this post from <a href="https://cur.at/1AagyEd?m=rss">Federico Zanetello</a>, but colour me impressed by it! This might save you from needing to fall back to UIKit controls quite so often from SwiftUI.</p>

<p>I also love when people use their blogs to write about things other people did. Federico should give himself some self-promotion credits to spend for doing this, and does it mean I get double for linking to someone that links to someone else? üòÇ</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/m0NYIzH?m=rss">Gradient Meshes in SceneKit</a></h4>
        <p>Drawing a gradient on iOS is easy, right? There are several built-in ways to do it, no matter which of Apple's UI frameworks you're using. Well, yes, if you want a boring old linear or maybe a radial gradient. What about a mesh gradient, though? Read on with this incredibly well put together article from <a href="https://cur.at/TGcZG6A?m=rss">Robb B√∂hnke</a>.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/PBiJjiy?m=rss">Dealing with view modifier values in SwiftUI</a></h4>
        <p>Like <a href="https://cur.at/JWFi8hL?m=rss">Daniel Tavares</a>, I've also been frustrated by the slightly messy code that comes from conditional SwiftUI view configuration. Check out <a href="https://cur.at/zfRykP3?m=rss">his gist</a> and this post, where he introduces a cleaner way of working.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/cv7hNmR?m=rss">Connecting to Wi-Fi programmatically in iOS</a></h4>
        <p>Who knew you could do this?! <a href="https://cur.at/bRQcnwI?m=rss">Filip Nƒõmeƒçek</a> showed me something I didn't know apps could do!</p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/TYzVdEO?m=rss">Screen Sizes</a></h4>
        <p>Do you remember when you only had to design your app for 320px by 480px screens? üòµ‚Äçüí´ Check out this great one-page app from <a href="https://cur.at/zRgGn4P?m=rss">Christopher Muller</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/E4k8PGh?m=rss">Trevor Kay</a>.</p>

      <h3>Books</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/aLacdwn?m=rss">Advanced Swift</a></h4>
        <p>If you've run out of things to learn, this new book from <a href="https://cur.at/qF33X9B?m=rss">Marin Bencevic</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/gIOUdMF?m=rss">Ray Fix</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/z4fxUz2?m=rss">Shai Mishali</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/xt7ewEP?m=rss">Ehab Amer</a> might be what you're looking for. It gives all the aspects of Swift that you know and love a much deeper look.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you're about to move on thinking you already read this book, it's important to note that this book is not <a href="https://cur.at/EsEzjBz?m=rss">the original Advanced Swift book</a> despite the titles being identical. Did we run out of book titles already? üòÇ</p>

<p>For full disclosure, I was provided with a review copy of this book.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>The <a href="https://cur.at/2FcrWGx?m=rss">last time I wrote about scam subscription apps</a>, I finished by saying this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Communication about what Apple is doing and how they think about these problems would be a huge step in the right direction.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, when Apple published a press release this week titled ‚Äú<a href="https://cur.at/Zyo1aoV?m=rss">App Store stopped more than $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions in 2020</a>‚Äù followed by 1,300 words about the measures they take to counter scam apps and fraudulent developers, I should have been thrilled.</p>

<p>Yes, I wish it hadn‚Äôt taken the <a href="https://cur.at/8f9v32Y?m=rss">discovery phase of a major lawsuit</a> to prompt them to make a statement, but I <em>am</em> happy that they‚Äôre talking about it.</p>

<p>The statistics they quote are impressive, too. As I suspected, there‚Äôs lots of work going on behind the scenes. $1.5B of prevented fraudulent transactions. 150,000 spam apps rejected. 470,000 developer accounts terminated. 250 <em>million</em> ratings and reviews removed. That‚Äôs a <em>lot</em>! What a great job they‚Äôve been doing. Right?</p>

<p>That‚Äôs certainly the message of this press release, but I‚Äôm afraid it did not make my wishes come true. My disappointment comes from <em>how</em> they talk about these problems. This is a press release, so it‚Äôs not a surprise that it paints a positive picture of the company, but they talk about these issues like they are completely solved and have been on top of the problem from the beginning. There‚Äôs no mention of ‚Äúwe have a lot of work to do‚Äù or any hint that the App Store isn‚Äôt a perfect fortress of impeccable moderation and scrutiny. The work they are doing is impressive, as I knew it would be, but the problem is a very long way from being solved. In fact, to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù it shouldn‚Äôt be the goal. To genuinely keep on top of it should be.</p>

<p>All of the talk about ‚Äúrelentless steps forward to combat these risks‚Äù would sound much more authentic if the scam apps were harder to find. Take a look at <a href="https://cur.at/MURiX60?m=rss">this tweet from Kosta Eleftheriou</a>, for example. It‚Äôs a screenshot of an app he created as a solo developer without access to any internal Apple systems, and it shows a list of problematic apps. It‚Äôs clear that the problem is not solved, and Apple is not keeping up.</p>

<p>I wish Apple could find a way to be more honest about some of the more negative aspects of the App Store in their developer communications. Yes, a press release isn‚Äôt the correct venue for that, especially with all the lawsuits, but it must be possible. If not, it‚Äôs time to shut us up by living up to the claims made in this press release. I think we‚Äôd all be happy with that as a solution instead. üëç</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/f2PyYye?m=rss">The Swift Mentorship Program</a></h4>
        <p>Have you ever wanted to contribute to an open-source project but didn't know where to start? It can be incredibly daunting, and without guidance, it's probably going to be challenging to land your first contributions successfully. This new programme is here to help. Apply and get matched with a mentor who will guide you through your first contributions to <em>any</em> Swift-based open-source project.</p>

<p>When I first saw this, I mistakenly thought that it was only for people who wanted to contribute to the Swift compiler project itself, <a href="https://cur.at/BquZjrA?m=rss">maybe because of the wording in this tweet</a>. I only say this just in case you also saw the tweet and took away the same impression. It's <em>any</em> Swift open-source project. Give the post itself a proper read.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://cur.at/aFCoux0?m=rss">The Swift Package Index</a> has applied to be part of this programme, so if you would like to help us make that better, please do apply! We'd love to work with you.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/D1hpQXt?m=rss">The internals of App Review‚Äôs testing process</a></h4>
        <p>Here's an interesting Twitter thread from <a href="https://cur.at/mK1vHJG?m=rss">Steve Troughton-Smith</a> with some details of App Review that have come out of the ongoing Apple vs Epic trial. It has been obvious from the start that a lot of the app validation is automated, but there's plenty of detail here we didn't know.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/4rM6rhU?m=rss">Introducing Plot Components</a></h4>
        <p>We're now in week three of the ongoing "everything must use a result builder" series here on iOS Dev Weekly, and this week's winner is none other than <a href="https://cur.at/BJud5P2?m=rss">John Sundell</a>! ü•Çüçæ Seriously though, this enhancement to <a href="https://cur.at/kcDWaEM?m=rss">Plot</a> to generate HTML from SwiftUI style components is another excellent use of the language feature. I have some concerns about how this might scale when working with more complex HTML interfaces, but it's an interesting idea.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/4YZwW8F?m=rss">TerminalUI</a></h4>
        <p>This was almost an "And finally..." link, and while it might still make you smile, it's more important than that. What would a SwiftUI layout look like in a text-only interface? <a href="https://cur.at/Ebsk6Lc?m=rss">Chris Eidhof</a> is doing some interesting experimentation. The idea is that a SwiftUI app UI should essentially "just work", but in a text-based user interface. I'm not sure this will be the next revolution in UI design, but it's certainly not a joke project.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/yXSxr6n?m=rss">Swift Actors: A Practical Example</a></h4>
        <p>One of the new features coming in Swift 5.5 is <a href="https://cur.at/PNbDB0K?m=rss">language support for Actors</a>. What are actors? I'll let <a href="https://cur.at/CDxleLn?m=rss">Marin Todorov</a> explain as he demonstrates them in this two-part (<a href="https://cur.at/H1uuNBQ?m=rss">1</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/5JpegkW?m=rss">2</a>) post. You'll need to download a nightly snapshot to follow along, but it makes for interesting reading even without!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/teLfnmE?m=rss">Spending an Hour Removing an Rounded Corners from an Image View</a></h4>
        <p>I enjoyed this story from <a href="https://cur.at/hKTKonI?m=rss">Lee Kah Seng</a> on debugging a "simple" problem in an app he was working on. A great reminder that Interface Builder, while very powerful, can hide things from you.</p>

        <p>This post from <a href="https://cur.at/msnhyVw?m=rss">Rishi Mody</a> has some <a href="https://cur.at/4nY11cR?m=rss">Facebook Paper</a> vibes to it. He talks about how the Instagram app implements several pieces of custom UI design. It's rare to see apps that really sweat interaction details like this these days.</p>

        <h4></h4>
        <p>You may think I talk about the <a href="https://cur.at/7mEp9HS?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a> too much in this newsletter, and you‚Äôre probably right. After all, it‚Äôs what I spend most of my time doing. You might be happy using CocoaPods or Carthage and don‚Äôt see any value in replacing something that still works well. I don‚Äôt blame you, but hold on before you skip down to this week‚Äôs links, give me one more paragraph. ü§û</p>

<p>We launched a new feature for the Swift Package Index this week, and it‚Äôs <strong>not only for people who use the Swift Package Manager</strong>! ‚Äú<a href="https://cur.at/ihGd8Zg?m=rss">Try in a Playground</a>‚Äù lets you generate a Swift Playground that you can open in Xcode that has a library pre-imported and ready to use. Visit any package page on the <a href="https://cur.at/7mEp9HS?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a>, click the ‚ÄúTry in a Playground‚Äù link, generate the playground, and a few seconds later, you‚Äôre ready to try it out. That‚Äôs a great feature, even if you eventually import the library to your app using CocoaPods or Carthage. üöÄ</p>

<p>If you want more details, here‚Äôs the <a href="https://cur.at/I4hvopv?m=rss">launch announcement for the feature</a>, or if you‚Äôre convinced and want to grab the app immediately, <a href="https://cur.at/ihGd8Zg?m=rss">download it here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and while we‚Äôre on the subject, this ‚ÄúTry in a Playground‚Äù button is a big part of why the Swift Package Index exists in its current form. I <a href="https://cur.at/YwM6pQQ?m=rss">wrote about that this week too</a>. I hope you enjoy the story!</p>

        <p>Privacy-focused analytics tools are on the rise right now. We're using <a href="https://cur.at/DDgczA2?m=rss">Plausible</a> for the <a href="https://cur.at/xzCP4d6?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a> (which I thoroughly recommend if you're looking for web analytics). If you're looking for something to put into your app, though, maybe check this new tool from <a href="https://cur.at/syKUssb?m=rss">Daniel Jilg</a> out. It certainly says all the right words on the web site!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/AOZQ8NK?m=rss">How OrderedSet works</a></h4>
        <p>As you might expect, the <a href="https://cur.at/TwukgjU?m=rss">Swift collections library</a> contains some clever thinking:</p>

<blockquote><p>My error was to equate ‚Äúhash table‚Äù with ‚Äúset or dictionary‚Äù in my head, but it turns out there are other kinds of hash tables.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cur.at/Hy5RyRu?m=rss">Ole Begemann</a> explains more.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/10tpMJr?m=rss">SwiftRegexDSL</a></h4>
        <p>Like attributed strings, regular expressions are notoriously challenging to read. What if you could describe your expression in descriptive terms? This new library from <a href="https://cur.at/uUw6tg2?m=rss">J√©r√©my Marchand</a> aims to let you do just that.</p>

<p>Also, my <a href="https://cur.at/O6DPbL8?m=rss">prediction on the rapid adoption of result builders</a> is coming true. I passed on about five other articles or libraries that used them this week. I think this library is <em>potentially</em> worthwhile if you do lots of regular expressions that you often need to edit. Still, the tactic of choosing dependencies carefully and cautiously is a good one.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/eIO9Oua?m=rss">The hidden secrets of SwiftUI&#39;s TabView</a></h4>
        <p>One aspect of SwiftUI that I love is that it takes a fresh look at UI controls based on how developers have been implementing apps for the last ten or more years. Do we truly need separate controls for swiping between pages, displaying pages in a tab bar, and pages in a carousel?  <a href="https://cur.at/3wKdGhd?m=rss">Kristaps Grinbergs</a> takes a look at one SwiftUI control that will tackle all three tasks.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/JonPxxR?m=rss">Abstracting Navigation in SwiftUI</a></h4>
        <p>I agree with <a href="https://cur.at/QoAjjGC?m=rss">Omar</a> that the mechanisms we have for navigation in the current version of SwiftUI favour simpler apps and can feel a little limiting as you grow. He proposes the approach of triggering navigation with a Combine publisher. I fear this may go too far the other way, but I enjoyed the article!</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>I lost about two hours yesterday to <a href="https://cur.at/nQjxcuf?m=rss">this tweet from Davide Di Stefano</a>. Xcode 2 was the first version I used, but this video of Xcode 3 from <a href="https://cur.at/PC2YiGT?m=rss">Kevin Vinck</a> took me on a delightful trip down memory lane, which ended in finding <a href="https://cur.at/jSO8LMH?m=rss">this YouTube channel</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/eCdZeHl?m=rss">this video introducing Project Builder</a>. Despite being such low resolution you can‚Äôt read the text, I watched more of it than I should have for a Thursday afternoon. üò¨ I loved seeing features in Project Builder that are still a part of Xcode today.</p>

<p>I was late to the Mac platform and only owned my first one in 2006, but once I jumped, there was no turning back. I quickly fell in love with the platform and with writing apps with Objective-C and Cocoa. Of course, iPhone OS and then iOS followed, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs tempting to mock these old versions of Xcode and Interface Builder. Just look at all those windows! However, my rose-coloured spectacles are fully functional, and I don‚Äôt feel anything but fondness for that software. The Mac, its development environment, and the community of incredibly passionate Mac developers that I found when I arrived were inspiring and exciting in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. My ex-colleagues mocked me gently, and I think they half expected my experiments with the Mac to be short-lived, but they were not!</p>

<p>So, I‚Äôd encourage you to join me in some nostalgia this Friday and think back to the first version of Xcode you used. Or, if your first version of Xcode was more recent, explore a bit of the history of developer tools on the Mac. üöÄ</p>

<p>By the way, my favourite parts of <a href="https://cur.at/RiYjO5z?m=rss">the video</a> were the warning about forgetting to save the IB file before building in Xcode and being tripped up by the text field cell inside the text field. Ah, memories!</p>

<p>Oh, and just before publishing, I saw <a href="https://cur.at/amkDZrd?m=rss">this tweet from Uli Kusterer</a>. What is it with the nostalgia this week?</p>

      <h3>News</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/XIwuK4U?m=rss">Swift 5.4 Released!</a></h4>
        <p>Along with Xcode 12.5 comes Swift 5.4. Here's <a href="https://cur.at/MFtUP8j?m=rss">Ted Kremenek</a>  with a rundown of what's new. You might already be aware of the language enhancements, but did you know about the improvements to developer tooling that come with it? That's a welcome step towards <a href="https://cur.at/osok3BL?m=rss">what I wished for</a> recently. üòç</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/XIwuK4U?m=rss">swift.org</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/QSuFTLG?m=rss">Craig Federighi Explains iOS 14.5&#39;s Privacy Features</a></h4>
        <p>The reasons that Craig Federighi is so well-loved come across so well in this interview with <a href="https://cur.at/cppDaS7?m=rss">Joanna Stern</a>. He's funny, charming, humble, and is just as comfortable doing a high-level interview like this one as talking on deeply technical topics. üòç</p>

<p>I'm not linking to this video <em>only</em> to say how great Craig is, though. The video is spot-on if you need a high-level explainer for letting company stakeholders and/or clients know what ATT is all about.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/QSuFTLG?m=rss">youtube.com</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/VQEp8MM?m=rss">What‚Äôs new in advertising attribution technologies</a></h4>
        <p>There has been plenty of talk about the restrictions on what you <em>can't</em> do in iOS 14.5, but what about what you <em>can</em> do? <code>SKAdNetwork</code> is an essential part of tracking the effectiveness of your app marketing efforts in a privacy-aware way, and I think Apple wanted to remind us of that.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/QjFrUtS?m=rss">Apply a device mask to screenshots from the iOS Simulator</a></h4>
        <p>This is a great little tip from <a href="https://cur.at/rkPvMgL?m=rss">Roman Shevtsov</a>. Even better, once you've set the option, the setting is respected for all future screenshots saved with ‚åòS. üëç</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/QFQwgjl?m=rss">Core Data and SwiftUI</a></h4>
        <p>I'm ashamed to say I've had this post from <a href="https://cur.at/jRGNV3G?m=rss">Dave DeLong</a> in my queue for a few weeks. I wanted to properly read and digest it and never managed to get there until today! He concentrates on separating Core Data away from your UI, and emitting results as structs rather than classes. Naturally, it was worth reading. üéÅ</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/QFQwgjl?m=rss">davedelong.com</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/tNKXPxP?m=rss">AccessibilitySnapshotColorBlindness</a></h4>
        <p>Like using multiple SwiftUI previews to simulate different execution environments, snapshot tests can be a great way to ensure that you're aware of how your changes affect how different people see your app. Yes, that could be as trivial as a light/dark mode change, which you probably test manually anyway. But what about colour blindness? Based on  <a href="https://cur.at/GEiJP5L?m=rss">SnapshotTesting</a>, this new library from <a href="https://cur.at/XMTW2vY?m=rss">James Sherlouk</a> helps keep track of how your app looks to people with a range of colour blindness conditions.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/onwiwnc?m=rss">Working with web content offline in SwiftUI apps</a></h4>
        <p>I enjoyed this article from <a href="https://cur.at/8Yd8CkQ?m=rss">Artem Novichkov</a>. I remember digging into whether it was possible to save web content from a web view <em>way</em> back when I considered writing an iOS app for this newsletter. At the time, it was full of issues, but there are many more options for doing it today. üöÄ</p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/4tIud6j?m=rss">If your app requests permission to access user data...</a></h4>
        <p><a href="https://cur.at/LToypcY?m=rss">Mike Stern</a> highlights this recent addition to <a href="https://cur.at/4wLVddj?m=rss">the HIG</a> that adds guidance around permission priming. The guidance is good and will hopefully move apps away from the common tricks designed to delay permission prompts.</p>

<p>However, the HIG is not the App Review Guidelines, so it'll be interesting to see how App Review deals with this. I didn't spot any changes in the App Review guidelines that reference this, so who knows if this will be something that will cause rejections.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>Something struck me as I watched the M1 chip appear in more hardware on Tuesday. It won‚Äôt be long until the whole Mac lineup has the same internals.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúlow‚Äù end of the Apple silicon Mac lineup now looks complete. The smaller laptops, Mac mini, and smaller iMac all have the same chip inside them, the M1. Yes, some of them have one less GPU core, but that‚Äôs such a minor difference it‚Äôs barely worth mentioning.</p>

<p>But what about the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù Macs? What about more than 16Gb RAM and high-end GPUs, and all the other things ‚ÄúPro‚Äù users want? I feel pretty confident that Apple will fall into the same consistent cycle for M-series chips that they have been so consistent with while producing the A-series. September will almost certainly bring us an A15 with the new iPhone, and I‚Äôd bet an M2 will accompany it with the capability for more memory and story around better or dedicated GPUs. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see the entire range of M1 upgraded to M2 chips immediately, but I think we‚Äôll see it happen before the M3 arrives. Maybe the highest-end machines will get more cores via an M2X or similar, but wouldn‚Äôt it be great if the whole Mac lineup had their chips upgraded every year, just like the iPhone and iPad do?</p>

<p>Do you know what that would mean? It would no longer be possible to buy a bad Mac! Just pick the form factor you‚Äôd like, and that‚Äôs it. Do you want a small laptop with a keyboard? MacBook Air. Want a desktop with a built-in screen? The iMac is for you. Which machine is faster for X, or Y task? That is no longer a valid question. It would also mean that there wouldn‚Äôt be a bad <em>time</em> to buy a Mac, as you‚Äôd never be more than a year behind the latest upgrades.</p>

<p>Why am I talking about this? Especially when <a href="https://cur.at/aLDGoy6?m=rss">I try not to make predictions or dwell on what might be coming next</a>. üò¨</p>

<p>The promise of SwiftUI is the software equivalent of the Apple silicon chips. You can‚Äôt pick the wrong framework, and your code will (largely) be compatible with any Apple platform. Just choose a platform (or platforms) you‚Äôd like to target and start creating.</p>

<p>We may not quite be there today, but we‚Äôre moving closer to that reality with every passing year. SwiftUI is the Apple silicon of software frameworks. ü§©</p>

        <p>If you've been putting off upgrading to Xcode 12, now is the time. As of Monday, you will be <em>required</em> to build with the iOS 14 SDK to submit apps to the store.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As always, this doesn't mean you can't support old versions of iOS, just that you need to compile against the latest SDK.</p>

        <p>Three of these four shortcuts are helpful no matter what UI framework you're using, but they become essential productivity boosters when working with SwiftUI view code. Thanks to <a href="https://cur.at/D0zGzdQ?m=rss">Sarun Wongpatcharapakorn</a> for putting this together.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/4616vcC?m=rss">TextBuilder</a></h4>
        <p>I feel like we might see overuse of result builders when Swift 5.4 gains adoption. It‚Äôs a fancy new language feature, and my gut feeling says people will <em>try</em> and find reasons to use them! üòÇ Building an attributed string <em>almost always</em> ends in ugly code, though, and that's where this package from <a href="https://cur.at/lt8ion4?m=rss">David Roman</a> will help out! It feels like a worthwhile use of a result builder too.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll notice a full complement of failing builds on the package index for this package. That's only because we're not yet checking compatibility with Swift 5.4, but we're <a href="https://cur.at/IRTkqN9?m=rss">working on it</a>!</p>

      <title>iOS Dev Weekly - Issue 503 - Apr 16th 2021</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who has a constant stream of ideas related to software I either work on now, or may work on in the future. The quality of my ideas varies wildly, and it‚Äôs often the worst ideas that shout loudest at me to drop everything and start working on them. üòÖ You‚Äôll never be perfect at knowing where to focus your attention, or at least I‚Äôve resigned myself to the fact that <em>I‚Äôll</em> never be perfect at it, but it‚Äôs an important thing to keep in mind.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the maturity of ideas this week, mostly because of this week‚Äôs release of <a href="https://cur.at/tKrXgCK?m=rss">Sourcery Pro</a> by <a href="https://cur.at/3kxxIoo?m=rss">Krzysztof Zab≈Çocki</a>. Would this app be as good as it is without the years of thought, development, and iteration that went into <a href="https://cur.at/ACLD0Z6?m=rss">Sourcery</a>? Almost certainly not. That experience drove the feature set and workflow, and the app is much better for it.</p>

<p>But does every idea need to be deliberated on for years? Nope! Some ideas benefit from a quick MVP and experimentation. For example, this newsletter. I had the idea to do it, and around a week later I sent the first issue.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to advise on this topic, but I think choosing what to pursue often comes down to how complex/significant the task is. I made the right decision to move quickly when deciding to start iOS Dev Weekly as the opportunity cost was small, and I took things much more slowly when considering whether to build the <a href="https://cur.at/7NA1kAA?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a>.</p>

<p>The original idea for building a package search engine popped into my head around two years before the launch of the index site, and a year before the <a href="https://cur.at/mGdSWYf?m=rss">SwiftPM Library</a>. I let the idea stew for a long while before starting as I knew the undertaking was significant.</p>

<p>What should you take from this? I think I might just have written the most obvious advice ever, but sometimes reading obvious stuff can still be useful. I‚Äôm also saying you should check out <a href="https://cur.at/tKrXgCK?m=rss">Sourcery Pro</a>. It‚Äôs good. üëç</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For full disclosure, I helped beta test Sourcery Pro.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/KWnZTrT?m=rss">39 Challenges of Building iOS Apps at Scale</a></h4>
        <p>How are some of the largest iOS apps built? The book Building Mobile Apps at Scale helps you overcome the most common challenges. Written by former Uber mobile engineer Gergely Orosz, the book is free for a limited time. <a href="https://cur.at/5oHnGxg?m=rss">Grab your copy now</a>.</p>

      <h3>News</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/OMnkdAe?m=rss">SwiftWinRT</a></h4>
        <p>I have no idea whether Swift on Windows will ever see widespread adoption, but I know that this package's release is a step towards that possibility. The fact that this work is primarily the result of one person's efforts is incredible. Thank you to <a href="https://cur.at/oP0CJ7T?m=rss">Saleem Abdulrasool</a> for all his efforts in this area.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://cur.at/ZPO2Ode?m=rss">note how <em>all</em> builds failed</a> when the package index tried to determine this package's compatibility? üò¨ Does that mean we need to add Windows build machines? üòÖ</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/OMnkdAe?m=rss">swiftpackageindex.com</a></p>
      <h3>Code</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/CAWGPIX?m=rss">JavaScriptCore and Swift</a></h4>
        <p>Like most people, I have mixed feelings about JavaScript. üò¨ Overall, there are far more positives to the language than there are negatives, but when you hit those negatives... No matter what you think of the language, there's no denying that it can be a powerful ally in your apps when used through JavaScriptCore. <a href="https://cur.at/rxN5QHQ?m=rss">Andy Ibanez</a> tells us more.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/CAWGPIX?m=rss">andyibanez.com</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/GE3wjti?m=rss">Refining Accessibility: Lessons Learned</a></h4>
        <p>I very nearly linked <a href="https://cur.at/IQTzqKd?m=rss">this article on creating a beautiful aurora background animation</a> from <a href="https://cur.at/qhqdPxY?m=rss">Matt Waller</a> last week. I'm so glad I waited because he followed it up with an even better post this week on the implications of blurring and animations on accessibility. Great article.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/GE3wjti?m=rss">cephalopod.studio</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/XuErwek?m=rss">Create Combine Publishers for HealthKit</a></h4>
        <p>Many articles that focus on Combine can be a little theoretical, but not this post from <a href="https://cur.at/yYVjiFk?m=rss">Isa Lima</a>! I like how she doesn't only concentrate on using Combine to move data around but also on using it for requesting HealthKit permissions.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/XuErwek?m=rss">isalima.xyz</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/FJb6Yh2?m=rss">Hacking native ARM64 binaries to run on the iOS Simulator</a></h4>
        <p>Let's finish up with <a href="https://cur.at/1GkPTag?m=rss">Bogo Giertler</a> teaching us more about XCFrameworks and ARM64 binaries than we'll ever need to know. How about that as a way to finish your Friday? üéâ</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/FJb6Yh2?m=rss">bogo.wtf</a></p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/G7mDrIa?m=rss">What If Your Designers Want a Baseline Grid on iOS?</a></h4>
        <p>This long and extremely detailed article from <a href="https://cur.at/5FUGc9Z?m=rss">Tammo Freese</a> is a must-read if you want your typography-focused app design to look good, especially if you're supporting dynamic text.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/G7mDrIa?m=rss">medium.com</a></p>
      <h3>Business and Marketing</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/w94NIT0?m=rss">Writing your App‚Äôs Privacy Policy</a></h4>
        <p>Even if you've been through and [answered all of the <a href="https://cur.at/FvG4l49?m=rss">App Store privacy questions</a>, you still need a separate privacy policy. Here's <a href="https://cur.at/zpz6Zaf?m=rss">David Olesch</a> with a good set of points to consider if you're going to write your own privacy policy.</p>
