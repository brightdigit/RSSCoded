                <description><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks show we (Scotty & John)  discuss the initial problems with iOS 8 for both users and developers. 
<br />We also ask is the iPhone 6 too big? Will we see a smaller 6S next year? Will see any new Macs or iPads this year? 
<br />Scotty also shares his git problems while John talks about some current debate about people baying iPhones just to ship to China.
<br />Finally Scotty announces he has left App.net.</p>

<p>Once again this week I (Scotty) have had recording problems and whole bunch of crackle appears at around 14 minutes.
<br />I am hoping this will never happen again as I have replaced my entire entire recording system since this recording in an attempt to solve the problem.</p>]]></description>
