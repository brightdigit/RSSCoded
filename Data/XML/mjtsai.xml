<blockquote cite="https://mailchi.mp/eb9158dad79e/v3n6-my-life-in-the-apple-ecosystem"><p>Apple giving a basic app away for free inhibits other developers from tackling that idea, and limits their ability to make enough money to warrant doing the hard investment in doing a real killer version of an app of that type. I do wish Apple would choose to either commit hard to an app and make it best of show, or kill the app and open the market to other companies. Instead, they do a middle policy of doing minimal work on an adequate app, making it harder for non-Apple apps to thrive, but not really serving the needs of the users very well, either.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Apple, I think, has too many things they&rsquo;ve built and committed to market and not enough resources committed to properly maintain and push them forward.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>A side aspect of this &ldquo;benign neglect?&rdquo; thing I see is that software quality at Apple, which for years was rock solid, has become more hit and miss.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>[Podcasts is] example of a bad trend I see out of Apple, a refusal to embrace and compete in existing market areas, but instead trying to use their existing ecosystem to force people into exclusive relationships with Apple.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>At Palm I was involved in the launch of the app store and the developer programs, and I really came to learn and love the challenges of that role. I also really came to believe -- and argue for -- strong support for the independent developers, not just for the big development houses, because I believe that&rsquo;s where the new developers mature out of that go on to big things, and that&rsquo;s where the true innovation on a platform happens.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Apple has never been that interested or great at relationships with developers, and I say that with great respect for many members of Apple&rsquo;s DTS/Devrel teams, some of whom are friends and who have spent years fighting the good fight internally as well.</p><p>It&rsquo;s gotten worse over the years, and while I will cut Apple some slack -- I don&rsquo;t think people remotely understand the complexity and difficulty of doing things at the scale Apple has to do them -- but where Apple has over the years had opportunities to improve things for developers and make these platforms more appealing, they have consistently chosen to not take those opportunities.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>App Review is far too often inconsistent, arbitrary and leaning into hostile and abusive.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>But if Apple were to ask my opinion, which it won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d suggest starting with asking itself why it decided words like &ldquo;arrogance&rdquo; and &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; were the defining points of their policies, and figure out how to replace &ldquo;how little can we do to stop the bleeding&rdquo; with &ldquo;what should we do to fix this?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Or I could have done a local backup before erasing my device, had I known that iCloud Backup should have an asterisk next to the name.</p>

<p>He had erased &ldquo;the iPad and give it to a family member so that they can teach during a pandemic&rdquo; and planned to restore from iCloud Backup later, unaware that iCloud deletes backups after 6 months, without telling you that it&rsquo;s going to do this, and even if your account isn&rsquo;t full.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about Apple&rsquo;s new foray into lossless, high-resolution, and Dolby Atmos music.

<p>But Apple has added music formats that can&rsquo;t even be played back on Macs, without changing a hidden setting.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The Music app doesn&rsquo;t cause this to change automatically, so you&rsquo;ll need to change it. And while you can probably leave it set to 96,000 Hz all the time, this could cause problems if you&rsquo;re playing back music at other sample rates.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had a great run, getting our legs under us a few months after the launch of Apple&rsquo;s App Store in 2008 but it&rsquo;s not feasible to keep the site up anymore. The largest factor was Apple&rsquo;s decision to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/01/apple-apps-affiliate-program-terminated/">remove apps from its affiliate program</a> back in 2018, which eliminated the largest source of revenue for AppShopper. Additionally, the App Store has changed dramatically over the years, with many developers moving to a free-to-download model and adding in-app purchases, decreasing the need to wait for a price drop in order to try an app, one of AppShopper&rsquo;s key features.</p>

<p>If you are using a non-US keyboard, prepare yourself to relearn a number of keyboard shortcuts in Monterey as the OS now translates shortcuts to the position of the key on the keyboard rather than the actual shortcut key.</p>
<p>Some seem uncomfortable with the idea but it actually fixes a number of shortcuts that were picked only because they work nicely on a US keyboard layout but are not so great or even terrible on other layouts. But yes this is going to be confusing and disrupting for awhile.</p>
<p>Actually some of the key translations do not preserve the position on the keyboard and pick some other keys. For example &lsquo;cmd ;&rsquo; translates to &lsquo;cmd )&rsquo; for me which are different keys on the keyboard. I&rsquo;m not sure what the logic is.</p>
<p>Most disturbing thing is it translates &lsquo;cmd 0&rsquo;, &lsquo;cmd 1&rsquo; and &lsquo;cmd 2&rsquo; to &lsquo;cmd &Agrave;&rsquo;, &lsquo;cmd &amp;&rsquo; and &lsquo;cmd &Eacute;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These are the same hardware keys but without having to hold shift which is ok but this also breaks using the numeric keypad.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/safari-browser-redesign-new-tab-groups/"><p>In addition, a new tab design on macOS puts your active tabs front and center, allowing you to see more of the page as you scroll. At the same time, the new tab bar takes on the color of the webpage and combines tabs, the tool bar, and the search field into a single compact appearance.</p>
<p>On iPad, the new tabs design and tab groups work just like on Mac, with instant syncing across devices. On iPhone, the new tab bar appears at the bottom under your thumb with a tap, and it&rsquo;s possible to swipe between them, or swipe up into a grid view.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/06/wwdc-2021-safari-15-to-bring-huge-ui-changes/">Stephen Hackett</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/06/wwdc-2021-safari-15-to-bring-huge-ui-changes/"><p>To further minimize Safari&rsquo;s UI, the tab bar and address field have been collapsed into one new user interface. When a tab is active, it expands into a full address field. Taken all together, Safari looks radically different than before[&#8230;]</p></blockquote>

<p>I think I like the changes for iPhone. The controls are easier to reach at the bottom of the screen, and it&rsquo;s quicker to switch between tabs.</p>
<p>For Mac, the new design makes no sense to me, and I&rsquo;ll likely switch to Chrome if it can&rsquo;t be disabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only does the location bar <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/1405348487546429448">move</a> when you change tabs, but, because it changes width, all the other tabs move, too. It feels disorienting.</li>
<li>With everything on one line, there&rsquo;s less space for tab text than before.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s harder to get at buttons and extensions <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402743028536819718">hidden</a> under the <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/1402715575449686016">&#8230; menu</a>.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s less empty space where it&rsquo;s safe for me to click in order to drag the window.</li>
<li>Having the page background color bleed into the tab area makes it harder to read, and it feels weird for the current page&rsquo;s color to affect the way <em>other</em> tabs look. It also works inconsistently, even on the same pages on Apple&rsquo;s site. At least there&rsquo;s a preference to turn it off.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purported benefit of all this is that you get slightly more vertical space to devote to the page content. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth the tradeoffs. If I wanted to save vertical space I would put the tabs in the sidebar (like <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1405597787555774480">in Edge</a>), which would also make it easier to see their titles when there are lots of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://relay.fm/upgrade/357">Upgrade</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://relay.fm/upgrade/357"><p>Jason isn&rsquo;t mad at Safari, just disappointed.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/blog/safari-15-chickenshit-minimalism/"><p>Over the past several releases of MacOS and iOS, Apple has experimented with hiding controls until users hover their cursor overtop, click, tap, or swipe. I see it as an extension of what <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm#minimalism">Maciej Ceg&#x142;owski memorably called</a> &ldquo;chickenshit minimalism&rdquo;. He defined it as &ldquo;the illusion of simplicity backed by megabytes of cruft&rdquo;; I see parallels in a &ldquo;junk drawer&rdquo; approach that prioritizes the appearance of simplicity over functional clarity. It allows UI designers to avoid making choices about interface hierarchy by burying everything but the most critical elements behind vague controls.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://morrick.me/archives/9368"><p>The utter user-interface butchery happening to Safari on the Mac is once again the work of people who put iOS first. People who by now <em>think</em> in iOS terms.

Unfortunately the effect is more like this person ends up looking&#8230; weird.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The point I&rsquo;m making with all this pixel peeping is that these are <em>negligible</em> measurements. Getting rid of the Tab bar with the excuse that you&rsquo;re saving space is the stinkiest bullshit I&rsquo;ve ever smelt in a while. 28 pixels for any of the current Mac displays is nothing.</p>

<p>This way of browsing is not a problem in search of a solution, Apple. You have so many more UI issues to fix, instead you add some more by &lsquo;revolutionising&rsquo; Safari.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m reserving judgement on the new design for now, but the radical changes coming in Safari 15 brings the sorry state of third-party browser support on iPhone and iPad to the fore. If the changes to the overall design make Safari miserable to use for you, you&rsquo;re basically stuck. [&#8230;]  Safari is the only game in town because Apple is unwilling to give developers the freedom to build apps that can actually compete.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/big-tech-antitrust-bills.html"><p>House lawmakers on Friday introduced sweeping antitrust legislation aimed at restraining the power of Big Tech and staving off corporate consolidation. If passed, the bills would be the most ambitious update to monopoly laws in decades.</p>
<p>The bills &mdash; five in total &mdash; take direct aim at Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google and their grip on online commerce, information and entertainment. The proposals would make it easier to break up businesses that used their dominance in one area to get a stronghold in another, would create new hurdles for acquisitions of nascent rivals and would empower regulators with more funds to police companies.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/the-cicilline-salvo/">Ben Thompson</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://stratechery.com/2021/the-cicilline-salvo/"><p>This bill, sponsored by Cicilline (D-RI) and co-sponsored by Lance Gooden (R-TX), bans covered platforms from giving an advantage to their own products, services, and lines of business over competitors; disadvantaging competing products, services, and lines of business; or discriminating between similarly situated business users.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<ul><li>Forbids the platform from restricting the right of third-party businesses to use their own data generated on the platform</li>
<li>Requires platform owners to allow users to uninstall pre-installed applications and change defaults</li>
<li>Bans anti-steering provisions (i.e. Spotify being able to tell iOS users to subscribe online or link to the web)</li>
<li>Restricts the platform owner from treating the platform&rsquo;s own products differently in search or rankings</li></ul></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/apple-pre-installed-apps-would-be-banned-under-antitrust-package">Rebecca Kern</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/apple-pre-installed-apps-would-be-banned-under-antitrust-package"><p>Cicilline told reporters Wednesday that a proposal prohibiting tech platforms from giving an advantage to their own products over those of competitors would mean Apple can&rsquo;t ship devices with pre-installed apps on its iOS operating platform.</p></blockquote>

<p>Via <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/us-antitrust-preinstalled-apps/">Nick Heer</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/us-antitrust-preinstalled-apps/"><p>I would love to know what Cicilline believes an empty shell of an operating system looks like.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>And what is the goal here? I agree in theory with limiting a platform owner&rsquo;s ability to use that unique power and privilege to stifle competition. But if a user has to configure everything about their system manually, well that just sounds horrible.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just to correct the record, this is not what Cicilline said. iPhones can be shipped with pre-installed apps, but Apple could not stop someone from un-installing or changing their default settings under the non-discrimination bill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another example of <em>Bloomberg</em>&rsquo;s stellar reporting, Kern has updated this article to reflect this understanding. However, in <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1405321019548651521">Benedict Evans&rsquo; analysis</a>, the actual text of the bill more closely reflects the initial report.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tperfitt/status/1400839275160158213">Timo Perfitt</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/tperfitt/status/1400839275160158213"><p>caching server utility is henceforth REJECTED from the app store. calling an apple command line tool to call another apple tool via XPC is FORBIDDEN and just because we have a TEMPORARY EXCEPTION it does not it should be USED.</p>
<p>i should appeal. i literally have no idea when temp exceptions are appropriate. is it when app wants to show preferential treatment to a specific developer?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>i call an apple tool as a normal user and get back json about caching servers on the network. i then format the data and display it to make it a useful IT tool. NOT ALLOWED.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can see where Apple&rsquo;s coming from because it probably didn&rsquo;t intend this XPC interface to be public API. But it would be nice to have a clearer policy of when you can use the <code>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name</code> entitlement and when you can&rsquo;t. There are definitely apps in the store that use it (including <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18995754">Microsoft Word</a>). This particular use seems harmless, and the app sounds useful.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxswd/status/1404985178104025092">Maxwell Swadling</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/mxswd/status/1404985178104025092">
<p>Unfortunately Apple is no longer accepting updates to Max Inspect, my app for inspecting entitlements, signing, etc. of Mac apps all in one place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Max Inspect also uses that entitlement and has been in the Mac App Store since 2018. Now it can no longer be updated due to an unannounced change to an unwritten rule. As far as I know, there is no other API for checking an app&rsquo;s notarization status. (<a href="https://mothersruin.com/software/Apparency/faq.html#sandboxing">Apparency</a> uses it, too.)</p>

<p>Remember when Phil Schiller <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1396811577442045953/photo/2">suggested</a> that the Mac App Store should be the &ldquo;go-to place&rdquo; for developer tools? That can&rsquo;t happen if the existing tools get kicked out.</p>

<p>Internet businesses are required to collect taxes in over 130 countries and in most US states. Staying compliant can be challenging, especially as your business scales. Tax rules and rates change constantly and vary based on what and where you sell. If you ignore these complexities, you risk paying penalties and interest on top of uncollected taxes.</p>
<p>We built Stripe Tax to simplify tax compliance, so you can focus on growing your business.</p></blockquote>
<p>They only charge 0.5%, but the catch seems to be that you still have to actually send the money to each jurisdiction multiple times per year. Apple, Paddle, and FastSpring will handle that for you.</p>

<p>iMessage stopped syncing my conversations&rsquo; unread status around the time I updated to Catalina. So I have to view each conversation on each device to clear the notification number.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In going after internet service providers (ISPs) for the actions of just a few of their users, Sony Music, other major record labels, and music publishing companies have found a way to cut people off of the internet based on mere accusations of copyright infringement. When these music companies sued Cox Communications, an ISP, the court got the law wrong. It effectively decided that the only way for an ISP to avoid being liable for infringement by its users is to terminate a household or business&rsquo;s account after a small number of accusations&mdash;perhaps only two. The court also allowed a damages formula that can lead to nearly unlimited damages, with no relationship to any actual harm suffered. If not overturned, this decision will lead to an untold number of people losing vital internet access as ISPs start to cut off more and more customers to avoid massive damages.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2021/06/08/ios-15-siri-offline-features/"><p>By running speech recognition directly on the device rather than continuing to rely on the cloud for speech-to-text processing, Siri now runs much faster simply because you don&rsquo;t have to wait for it to finish talking to the cloud just so she could understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Now Apple&rsquo;s digital assistant is much snappier for requests that don&rsquo;t require online sources! Also, Siri on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 takes advance of on-device personalization, which lets its speech-recognition engine and understanding improve as you use your device.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>With Siri&rsquo;s speech-recognition engine processing the audio of your request without uploading it to Apple&rsquo;s servers, your privacy actually increases when using offline Siri.</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally we get back <a href="https://mashable.com/2012/02/02/iphone-voice-control-commands/">offline voice control</a>, which&mdash;since Siri was added in 2011&mdash;has only worked when Siri was disabled. Aside from improving performance and reliability, this should also reduce cellular data usage. Unfortunately, one of the main things I do with Siri is make reminders, and despite seemingly not requiring any Internet data lookup, that is apparently not one of the features available for offline use.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523438/apple-iphone-siri-on-device-processing-ios-15-wwdc-privacy">Mitchell Clark</a>:</p>

<p>Apple processing Siri requests on-device should help its users be more confident about the privacy of their data: back in 2019, we learned that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8932064/apple-siri-private-conversation-recording-explanation-alexa-google-assistant">contractors were listening to some Siri requests</a>, something that wouldn&rsquo;t happen if those requests were being handled by your phone alone. While Apple eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836760/apple-apology-siri-audio-recordings-privacy-changes-contractors">tried to make that situation right</a> by being more transparent and making Siri recordings opt-in, handling more Siri requests on the phone is a good way to make the service a little more trustworthy.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/study-finds-scam-top-paid-apps-app-store/"><p>Apple has used its app review process as a bulwark in recent legal assaults on its App Store policy, and put particular emphasis on the security benefits for iOS users when buying apps. However, an investigation has found that almost 2% of the top 1,000 highest grossing apps on a given day were some sort of scam.</p><p>According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, which conducted the investigation, scam apps have been &ldquo;hiding in plain sight&rdquo; in Apple&rsquo;s  App Store, including several VPN apps that duped users into paying for software they didn&rsquo;t need, a QR code reader that asked users for a $5 weekly subscription for a feature that&rsquo;s already built into Apple&rsquo;s native Camera app, and some apps that fraudulently appropriated the branding of Amazon and Samsung.</p></blockquote>

<p>It would be interesting to know how that compares with the Google Play Store. Given that most of the revenue comes from a small fraction of the apps, you&rsquo;d think that the highest grossing ones could be especially well vetted. Instead, as Kosta Eleftheriou has reported, looking at the top charts seems to be a good way of finding scams.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=dovxb62h"><p>In addition, two updates have been made to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/">App Review contact form</a>. If you appeal an app rejection, you can now specify if you believe your app was rejected due to unfair treatment (including political or other bias). And you can now report an app if you believe it presents a trust or safety concern, or is in violation of the App Store Review Guidelines. </p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html">Keith Collins</a>, in 2019:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html"><p>But as Apple has become one of the largest competitors on a platform that it controls, suspicions that the company has been tipping the scales in its own favor are at the heart of antitrust complaints in the United States, Europe and Russia.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s apps have ranked first recently for at least 700 search terms in the store, according to a New York Times analysis of six years of search results compiled by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Some searches produced as many as 14 Apple apps before showing results from rivals, the analysis showed. (Though competitors could pay Apple to place ads above the Apple results.)</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Spotify complained to European regulators in March that Apple was abusing its role as the gatekeeper of the App Store. By April, all but two of Apple&rsquo;s apps disappeared from the top results for &ldquo;music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An Apple spokeswoman said the company could not verify the data because it did not keep a record of historical search results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like it has never tried to calculate whether the App Store is <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/05/21/epic-v-apple-day-15/">profitable</a>. Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue said that Apple <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1401905981085343749">wasn&rsquo;t</a> putting its thumb on the scale. Rather, &ldquo;the algorithm had been working properly. They simply decided to handicap themselves to help other developers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the Epic trial has revealed an <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1401902273991696392">e-mail from Tim Sweeney</a> reporting that Apple&rsquo;s then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Files_(Apple)">Files app</a> was ranking ahead of Dropbox when searching for &ldquo;Dropbox.&rdquo; In the replies from Apple employees, we learn from Debankur Naskar, the lead for &ldquo;SEO experiences in the App Store&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1401902273991696392/photo/3"><p>I think the Files app was manually boosted on the top for the query &ldquo;Dropbox&rdquo; during last WWDC. We are removing the manual boost and the search results should be <a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1401944514223382529">more relevant</a> now[&#8230;]</p></blockquote>

<p>It would be nice if we could chalk this up to one rogue employee, but the e-mails show that Naskar&rsquo;s boss, VP Matt Fischer, didn&rsquo;t admonish him for <em>gaming</em> the search results, but rather for doing so without first <em>getting his approval</em> to do so. It sure doesn&rsquo;t sound like Apple has ruled out such manipulation.</p>

<p>Somewhere there&rsquo;s probably a similar e-mail explaining Bing&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8v9m/bing-censors-tank-man">accidental</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/04/microsoft-bing-tiananmen-tank-man-results">human error</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017">Sean Hollister</a> (<a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/21/06/11/1946243/apple-admits-it-ranked-its-files-app-ahead-of-competitor-dropbox">Slashdot</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017"><p>Apple tells <em>The Verge</em> that what we think we&rsquo;re seeing in these emails isn&rsquo;t quite accurate. While Apple didn&rsquo;t challenge the idea that Files was unfairly ranked over Dropbox, the company says the reality was a simple mistake: the Files app had a Dropbox integration, so Apple put &ldquo;Dropbox&rdquo; into the app&rsquo;s metadata, and it was automatically ranked higher for &ldquo;Dropbox&rdquo; searches as a result.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slightly skeptical of that explanation &mdash; partially because it doesn&rsquo;t line up with what Naskar suggests in the email, partially because Apple <em>also</em> told me it immediately fixed the error (despite it apparently continuing to exist for 11 months, hardly immediate), and partially because the company repeatedly ignored my questions about whether this has ever happened with other apps before.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Besides, the distinction between a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; boost and any other kind of boost may be purely academic. Algorithms are written by people, after all. If Apple can build a 42-factor algorithm that gives its own apps favorable results, why would it need to override that algorithm and risk its emails getting caught up in a lawsuit years from now?</p>
<p>It could just tweak that algorithm at will &mdash; which is exactly what it did to resolve the <em>WSJ</em> and<em> NYT</em>&rsquo;s scrutiny two years ago.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100">Jasmine</a> (via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27451689">Hacker News</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100"><p>I cofounded @fanhouseapp 8 months ago to empower creators to monetize their content. We pay creators 90% of earnings. Now, Apple is threatening to remove Fanhouse from the app store unless we give them 30% of creator earnings.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In writing and over the phone, we explained to Apple that we could pay them 30% of our revenues (from our 10% take rate). It&rsquo;ll be harder to cover costs and build features as a startup, but at least it&rsquo;d be coming from us. Apple insisted on taking 30% of creators&rsquo; total earnings.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"><p>If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like this rule for many reasons, including that it makes certain business models, like <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/02/15/app-store-subscriptions/">selling e-books</a>, impossible because Apple&rsquo;s 30% would mean losing money on each sale. And it doesn&rsquo;t seem fair for the hardware platform vendor to get a larger cut than the site/app/content platform that connected the creator and fan and delivered the content.</p>

<p>That said, reading the rule, it seems very clear, and I wondered why Funhouse would go to the effort of developing an app that tries to get away without using In-App Purchase when they&rsquo;d only be forced to remove it.</p>

<p>That is, I wondered until I saw that Fanhouse&rsquo;s presumably largest competitor, Patreon, gets to do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525904/fanhouse-apple-tax-app-store-creator-fees">Jacob Kastrenakes</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525904/fanhouse-apple-tax-app-store-creator-fees">
<p>Apple allows Patreon to offer third-party payment solutions for creators rather than use in-app purchases, avoiding the fee. Other apps aren&rsquo;t afforded that privilege. Apple and Patreon did not respond to a request for comment on the arrangement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/wwdc-2021-for-developers/">Nick Heer</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/wwdc-2021-for-developers/">
<p>I tried upgrading one of my subscriptions to a level that had entirely digital perks, and Patreon threw up its own payment form. I tried subscribing to a creator account and once again saw Patreon&rsquo;s own form, not an in-app purchase dialog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the distinction between Patreon and other apps that sell content. But, whatever it is, Apple seems to have agreed last year when it approved Fanhouse that it fell into the same category. Now, it&rsquo;s changing its mind about Fanhouse, but presumably not about Patreon, so it&rsquo;s even less clear <a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691139308863491">what the rules are</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691139308863491"><p>Why do big corporations that can afford to pay get the biggest breaks?</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s also the famous rule created for WeChat:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">
<p>(vii) Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does the 100% mean they lose money on credit card transactions? And why can you give money to other users and buy them physical goods, or buy ads from the developer of an app, but you aren&rsquo;t allowed to tip the developer of the app?</p>

<blockquote cite="https://spencerdailey.com/2018/06/27/could-you-disable-your-admin-password-a-stressful-opsec-story-from-an-apple-store/"><p>Back in 2018, I encountered what I&rsquo;d consider the cardinal sin of opsec by an Apple store employee. He asked me to <em>disable</em> my Mac&rsquo;s password before I turned it in for a multi-day off-site repair. The casual manner in which he asked me led me to assume this was not the first time he had pushed this question, and that it was a common practice at this store (Barton Creek Mall in south Austin, for those who care).</p>
<p>Apple customers already place a great deal of trust in repair technicians who <em>have </em>the user&rsquo;s password, but disabling it for logging in means everyone who <em>handles</em> or has physical access to the device could trivially steal data from it or install malware on it. A Mac going offsite gets handled by several intermediaries, not just the technicians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only safe option is to make several backups and then erase the device before getting it repaired.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-pays-out-millions-in-compensation-to-student-after-iphone-repair-facility-shared-her-explicit-personal-images-online/"><p>Apple has settled a case with a 21-year-old student after she sent her iPhone to a repair facility in 2016 only to find that employees had uploaded personal explicit images and videos to her Facebook account from the phone during the repair process.</p>
<p>The student had sent in her iPhone to Apple to get repaired. The invasion of privacy ultimately took place at a repair center in California, run by Pegatron, an Apple contractor. <em>The Telegraph </em><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/06/06/apple-pays-millions-woman-explicit-photos-posted-online/">reports Apple paid out</a> millions in settlement compensation.</p></blockquote>

<p>2016, meaning that this lawsuit was already well underway when Apple&rsquo;s lobbyist recently <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/03/30/more-apple-repair-providers-and-lobbying/">argued</a> against independent repair shops on the grounds that its own repair service offered better privacy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50700/apple-insurance-and-stolen-photos-the-authorized-service-scandal">Kevin Purdy</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50700/apple-insurance-and-stolen-photos-the-authorized-service-scandal"><p>This kind of arrangement isn&rsquo;t unusual. In fact, large companies almost always outsource repair and servicing to third parties. But it is also not something they readily acknowledge when they&rsquo;re arguing against right to repair laws. And for good reason. As it turns out: the incidence of misdeeds by employees at authorized service providers are actually pretty common &#x2013; and certainly no less common than independent repair shops. In 2019, for example, an Apple Genius Bar employee was caught <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/12/an-apple-store-employee-helped-customerby-texting-himself-private-photo-her-phone/">texting intimate photos of a customer to himself </a>under the guise of helping her with a repair. The same thing happened in 2016 at an Apple Store in Brisbane, Australia.</p><p>Also, there is lots of evidence that, far from emphasizing quality of service, OEMs work to spend as little as possible on authorized repair. Note the 2019 ICE raid on a Texas-based Samsung authorized repair provider CVE Technology that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwbnpd/ice-raid-on-samsung-repair-contractor-shows-big-techs-reliance-on-exploitative-labor">discovered undocumented workers performing authorized repair on Samsung devices</a>.</p><p>In fact, when asked directly at the 2019 FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/nixing-fix-workshop-repair-restrictions">Nix the Fix symposium</a> whether there was any data to support industry&rsquo;s contention that authorized repair is either higher quality or more secure than independent repair, Walter Alcorn of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) admitted straight out that there was none.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-reveals-redesigned-weather-ios-app/"><p>Apple today at WWDC revealed a new iOS weather app with additional features, like full-screen maps and live weather notifications. The new app includes many features similar to Dark Sky, which Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky/">acquired</a> last year.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also new animated backgrounds that more accurately reflect the sun&rsquo;s position and precipitation, and notifications highlight when rain or snow starts and stops.</p></blockquote>

<p>This looks much improved, though I&rsquo;m not sure yet whether it will win me over.</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/11/ios-15-weather-app-hands-on/">Chance Miller</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/11/ios-15-weather-app-hands-on/">
<p>One of the headlining changes in the iOS 15 Weather app is the interface. It features an all-new design that changes based on the current conditions in your area. For example, if it&rsquo;s raining outside or there is rain coming soon, the app will adjust its layout to show the hourly forecast, next-hour precipitation, and the radar at the top.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there&rsquo;s no rain in your area, the app focuses on the 10-day forecast and current conditions at the top, and pushes other things such as the radar towards the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope it&rsquo;s not like the Mac Weather widget, where the 5-day forecast&mdash;yes, Macs only get half as many days&mdash;completely disappears when it&rsquo;s currently raining.</p>

<p>Sadly, despite the new Weather app being written using the cross-platform SwiftUI, it won&rsquo;t be coming to iPadOS or macOS this year. The Translate app, introduced in iOS 14, still isn&rsquo;t available for Mac, either.</p>

<p>In iOS 15, Apple is introducing a new feature called Live Text that can recognize text when it appears in your camera&rsquo;s viewfinder or in a photo you&rsquo;ve taken and let you perform several actions with it.</p>
<p>For example, Live Text allows you to capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call, or look up a location name in Maps to get directions. It also incorporates optical character recognition, so you can search for a picture of a handwritten note in your photos and save it as text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This looks really cool. I find it hard to believe that Intel Macs aren&rsquo;t fast enough to support it, though. And why doesn&rsquo;t it work in Preview?</p>

People set as an Account Recovery Contact will be able to help you regain access to your  Apple ID  should you forget your password.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see Apple catching up here. However, it&rsquo;s not clear to me whether this means that your Legacy Contacts will be able to legally access content that you had purchased from the iTunes Store or App Store. Apple can offer direct access to photos, but other data can only be accessed by running an app.</p>

I&rsquo;m not sure how much you can do with the apps, though, because how would you associate them with your data from the backup? And how could they operate on <em>your</em> iCloud data while running on your legacy contact&rsquo;s device?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2012, with the release of Xcode 4.4 and LLVM 4.0, Apple introduced Objective-C literals for three more common Objective-C types: NSArray, NSDictionary, and NSNumber.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>However, unlike NSStrings, these literals were just syntactic sugar for calls to the regular alloc/init methods at runtime, and as such they couldn&rsquo;t be used to initialize global variables.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Xcode 13 ships with a new major release of Clang/LLVM, version 13. New in this release is support for constant literals for NSNumber, NSArray, and NSDictionary.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I take this to mean that even where these kinds of literals are not used to initialize global variables, ie. anywhere else they&rsquo;re used in your code, the compiler may optimize them into the CONST section of your binary.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apple has updated the plutil command line tool included with Xcode so that it can create Objective-C source files containing constant literals from plist data.</p>

<p>In  iOS 15  and its sister updates, you can create a link to a  FaceTime  conversation that can be shared anywhere. Using this link, friends and family members who do not have an Apple device can log into a  FaceTime  call using a web browser.</p>
<p>Non-Apple users can join a one-on-one  FaceTime  call or a Group  FaceTime  call, effectively making  FaceTime  a more platform-agnostic video service that is no longer just limited to iOS users. You do, however, need an iOS user to start a  FaceTime  call and send a link.</p>

Discover how you can elevate the capabilities of your app by exposing those features as Shortcuts actions. We&rsquo;ll show you how to build actions for your macOS apps built with Catalyst or AppKit, deploy actions across platforms, publish and share shortcuts, and enable your app to run shortcuts from other apps. We&rsquo;ll also take you through how Shortcuts fits in with existing Mac automation technologies like Automator and AppleScript.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/shortcuts-app-coming-to-mac/">Mitchel Broussard</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/shortcuts-app-coming-to-mac/"><p>Shortcuts will be integrated throughout  macOS Monterey, in the menu bar, Finder, Spotlight, and even with Siri. Apple also noted that users will be able to import existing Automator workflows into Shortcuts, and Automator will remain supported.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shortcuts-for-mac/">Stephen Hackett</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/06/wwdc-2021-shortcuts-for-mac/"><p>Developers of traditional Mac apps &mdash; even those built with AppKit &mdash; can add Shortcuts support to their projects via Intents, just like support is added in iOS apps.</p>
<p>That might seem surprising, but considering that Apple pitched this as the start of a longer transition, getting traditional Mac apps on board is going to be required if Apple wants to discontinue Automator somewhere down the line.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Moving workflows from Automator to Shortcuts couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Drag and drop your .workflow file onto Shortcuts, and it will be transformed into a Shortcut automatically.</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems to be because Apple has re-implemented its own built-in Automator actions in Shortcuts. Third-party Automator actions don&rsquo;t work in Shortcuts.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/handleym99/status/1401977475706462215">Maynard Handley</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/handleym99/status/1401977475706462215"><p>Does it have debugging?</p>
<p>Does it have logging?</p>
<p>Does it have the ability to cut and paste SECTIONS of a shortcut?</p>
<p>To duplicate then modify a shortcut?</p></blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, the answers to these questions are No, except that you <em>can</em> duplicate shortcuts and then edit them. I wasn&rsquo;t able to play around with Shortcuts much because it kept crashing in SwiftUI (which it&rsquo;s implemented using). I was curious to try the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10018">SwiftUI focus and keyboard navigation</a> features, but alas they seem to be a work in progress.</p>

<p>Overall, maintaining support for old devices while restricting certain new features to more capable recent models is a great strategy. That way, fewer people are forced to buy new hardware just to participate, but the new features encourage hardware upgrades for those who want to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig into the details, first for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, moving on to macOS 12 Monterey with side trips for Universal Control and AirPlay on Mac, and finishing off with watchOS 8.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, major versions of macOS have brought huge changes which many users are still wrestling with: a brand new file system (APFS in 10.13), privacy controls (10.14 onwards), loss of support for 32-bit code (10.15), notarization (10.15), startup volume groups (10.15), and sealed system volumes (11), for example. This year there don&rsquo;t appear to have been any such shocks coming in the new.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"><p>All it takes is some bedtime reading of <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf">Epic&rsquo;s 365-page findings document</a> to see just how aggressive Apple executives have gotten in carrying out Steve Jobs&rsquo; 2010 vision to, as the finding document quotes him, &ldquo;tie all our products together so we further lock customers into our ecosystem.&rdquo;</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Those of us living with multiple Apple gadgets know the garden is pretty darn nice. We&rsquo;re suffering no more than that person seated in first class next to the lavatory. But are we missing out?</p><p>I set up camp in the increasingly harmonious Android/Windows garden, talked to experts and dug through court documents. In the end, I found three strong reasons to justify Apple&rsquo;s garden&mdash;and three strong reasons we need more holes in its walls.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/06/theme-parks-and-public-parks">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/06/theme-parks-and-public-parks">
<p>The people who use the term &ldquo;walled garden&rdquo; in this context typically do so as a pejorative. But that&rsquo;s not right. Literal walled gardens can be very nice&#x2009;&mdash;&#x2009;and the walls and gates can be what makes them nice.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Better than &ldquo;walled garden&rdquo;, I like the comparison to theme parks. People love theme parks. Not everyone, of course, but a lot of people. They&rsquo;re fun, safe, and deliver a designed experience. They&rsquo;re also expensive, and the food, to put it kindly, generally sucks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Point taken, but I think this analogy breaks down because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A walled garden is not the only way of achieving the benefits he describes. For example, Apple could have made uninstalling easy on the Mac, if it wanted to.</p></li>
<li><p>The promise is that iOS and the App Store offer a Disneyesque experience, but that&rsquo;s far from the reality. One of my main takeways from the Epic trial is how successful the <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/06/22/the-app-store-doesnt-make-apps-safe/">marketing</a> as been, how many people believe Apple is protecting them in ways that it absolutely <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/04/22/the-app-store-isnt-catching-the-most-egregious-scams/">is</a> <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/12/24/apples-privacy-nutrition-labels-are-a-blessing-and-a-curse/">not</a>. Poorly built walls can actually <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1401624005707194369">make things worse</a>. iOS is not Disneyland. Android, despite the FUD, is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Park">Action Park</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>And, even if they were, those shouldn&rsquo;t be the only two choices. iOS is not a place where you choose to vacation now and then. It&rsquo;s where you live. The world shouldn&rsquo;t be <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/08/25/potential/">limited</a> to two theme parks that you can never leave.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"><p>During the <em>Epic v. Apple</em> trial, a new metaphor popped into my head and I can&rsquo;t shake it. As I was looking at the emails that Apple executives were sending each other and reading their testimony during the trial, I kept thinking I&rsquo;d seen this kind of behavior and even some of the justifications before. And so here it is:</p><p>Apple is a carrier.</p><p>I mean &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; as in cellular network carrier, as in Apple is Verizon or T-Mobile or (shudder) AT&amp;T. Here&rsquo;s how the metaphor works: The most important thing to any carrier is feeding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11193086/verizon-att-carrier-crapware-revenue-trick-samsung-software">Angry God of ARPU</a> (average revenue per user). That number must go up to please shareholders and pay executives, and the carriers have engaged in any number of shenanigans to make it happen.</p>

<p>Before the iPhone, carriers could (and did) point to any number of smartphones and rightfully boast about the incredible things those phones enabled. The Blackberry, the Treo, the Moto Q, and more all did things that nobody would have thought possible just a few years before. But the carriers would take credit for them while at the same time making demands that kneecapped those phones&rsquo; capabilities. They used their monopoly on wireless customers to dictate phone design, software capabilities, and business models.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/06/13/last-week-on-my-mac-the-elephant-at-wwdc/">
<p>Third-party attempts to document Mac OS X have been brave, but none has stood the pace of change. Amit Singh&rsquo;s <em>Mac OS X Internals</em> from 2006 was replaced around 2017 by Jonathan Levin&rsquo;s outstanding trilogy <em>*OS Internals,</em> which was marred only by its lack of an index. But no sooner had Levin completed his series than he abandoned it in favour of documenting Android.</p>
<p>DocC looks exciting, and demonstrates that Apple recognises its problem, at least in part. But it falls into several well-known traps.</p>
<p>First, it concentrates on documenting calls within an API by individual function. For a developer who already understands how that sub-system in macOS works, that&rsquo;s essential. But trying to grok major topics like Attributed Text simply isn&rsquo;t possible by referring to individual functions within the API. You first need to get your head around how sub-systems are designed and function, the conceptual information which Apple was once so good at providing. Good conceptual documentation is structured and written quite differently from that for classes and functions with an API, as Apple well knows.</p>

Maybe a group&rsquo;s wiki had some crystallized documentation or high level architectural descriptions but good luck accessing it from outside that org.

<blockquote cite="https://mrmacintosh.com/how-to-downgrade-bridgeos-on-an-intel-t2-mac-with-apple-configurator-2/"><p>Let&rsquo;s go over a quick example of why you might want to downgrade BridgeOS. You updated to macOS Big Sur 11.4 from 11.3. After the update, you&rsquo;ve found that something is not working right. The T2 chip handles many things including, fan speed, battery, power, charging &amp; sound (speakers &amp; microphone). So in this example, maybe you are getting audio cracking noise (has happened in the past). Now you thinking that the new version of bridgeOS might be causing problems on your T2 Mac.</p>
<p>The 2nd example is macOS Update testing. If you are a system administrator in charge of updating a large fleet of Mac testing is very important. Part of that macOS Update process is updating BridgeOS. An example of this is if you upgrade a T2 Mac from 11.3 to 11.4. BridgeOS is updated in the process. Now that this T2 Mac is on the latest version of BridgeOS it normally can not be downgraded. Even if you boot back to recovery and install 11.3, BridgeOS will remain the same updated version. Set this Mac on the shelf because you will never be able to take it through a full update process again until 11.5.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>You could always upgrade BridgeOS via automatic download with Apple Configurator 2.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We can now download full BridgeOS IPSW Files directly from Apple the same way we do now with Apple Silicon M1 Macs. We can then use the BridgeOS IPSW File to restore/revive BridgeOS to your T2 Mac. The difference here is that Apple WILL stop signing for previous versions of BridgeOS. The signing process follows iOS and is canceled usually about one week after the release of a new update. Apple leaves ONE previous version signed (for 7 days) so you can now downgrade to that version!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/06/10/firmware-and-recovery-upgrades-and-downgrades-on-different-macs/">
<p>Let me ask you a simple question: supposing you installed the Monterey beta on an external disk, what would happen to that Mac&rsquo;s firmware and its Recovery features? Given that Monterey is likely to bring firmware updates to most if not all Macs, how might that affect yours? That&rsquo;s what I try to answer in this article &#x2013; and it&rsquo;s of great importance to all those who install beta-releases, as well as everyone considering upgrading in the autumn/fall.</p>
<p>The answer to these questions depends on which architecture your Mac has, and how it stores and maintains the different parts of what we loosely refer to as firmware.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://m1racles.com"><p>A flaw in the design of the Apple Silicon &ldquo;M1&rdquo; chip allows any two applications running under an OS to covertly exchange data between them, without using memory, sockets, files, or any other normal operating system features. This works between processes running as different users and under different privilege levels, creating a covert channel for surreptitious data exchange.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is baked into Apple Silicon chips, and cannot be fixed without a new silicon revision.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The ARM system register encoded as s3_5_c15_c10_1 is accessible from EL0, and contains two implemented bits that can be read or written (bits 0 and 1). This is a per-cluster register that can be simultaneously accessed by all cores in a cluster.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Really, nobody&rsquo;s going to actually find a nefarious use for this flaw in practical circumstances. Besides, there are already a million side channels you can use for <i>cooperative</i> cross-process communication (e.g. cache stuff), on every system. Covert channels can&rsquo;t leak data from <i>uncooperative</i> apps or systems.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lux.camera/lux-year-4-doubling-down/">Ben Sandofsky</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/halidecamera/status/1400187973962928131">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://lux.camera/lux-year-4-doubling-down/">
<p>There&rsquo;s powerful App Store features only supported though subscriptions: a paid app has one price, that is more or less the same around the world. With subscriptions, you can set per-country pricing.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Half the challenge of a big upgrade is supporting the old version of your app. In small updates, you would build your new features into the old app hidden behind flags, and un-hide them when they&rsquo;re ready to release. We couldn&rsquo;t do that in our case, because too much of Mark II would change. When we say it was like a whole new app, we really mean it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>There was one post-launch surprise that was out of our control: the only way for us to offer the choice between Pay-Once and subscriptions is to make the app free to download, and throwing up a &ldquo;paywall&rdquo; at launch. The App Store doesn&rsquo;t surface this clearly: it just lists it on the &ldquo;Free&rdquo; charts. Many folks downloaded Halide expecting it to be free, and get upset that we ask for payment.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We dug deeper and found it to be a bug when iOS needs to free up memory. Sometimes iOS terminates the program that manages your photo library assetsd. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do short of telling users to restart their phone.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>While subscribers outnumber Pay-Once buyers by almost five to one, Pay-Once revenue makes up 39% of total revenue. We really think that it&rsquo;s important to cater to a segment of your users that would not even consider a subscription at any cost out of principle.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.jamf.com/blog/zero-day-tcc-bypass-discovered-in-xcsset-malware/">
<p>In the latest macOS release (11.4), Apple patched <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30713">a zero-day exploit</a> (CVE-2021-30713) which bypassed the Transparency Consent and Control (TCC) framework. This is the system that controls what resources applications have access to, such as granting video collaboration software access to the webcam and microphone, in order to participate in virtual meetings. The exploit in question could allow an attacker to gain Full Disk Access, Screen Recording, or other permissions without requiring the user&rsquo;s explicit consent &mdash; which is the default behavior. We, the members of the Jamf Protect detection team, discovered this bypass being actively exploited during additional analysis of the XCSSET malware, after noting a significant uptick of detected variants observed in the wild. The detection team noted that once installed on the victim&rsquo;s system, XCSSET was using this bypass specifically for the purpose of taking screenshots of the user&rsquo;s desktop without requiring additional permissions.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>If any of the appID&rsquo;s are found on the system, the command returns the path to the installed application. With this information, the malware crafts a custom AppleScript application and injects it into the installed, donor application.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Once all files are in place, the custom application will piggyback off of the parent application, which in the example above is Zoom. This means that the malicious application can take screenshots or record the screen without needing explicit consent from the user. It inherits those TCC permissions outright from the Zoom parent app.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Apple&rsquo;s fix does not seem to precisely target the actual vulnerability and introduced <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/06/01/macos-11-4-breaks-full-disk-access-for-helper-tools/#comment-3465376">more problems</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a cloud hovering over Apple Park again, and it&rsquo;s not just the pandemic. It&rsquo;s bruised developer relations. It&rsquo;s alleged anti-trust violations. It&rsquo;s App Store scammy-ness. It&rsquo;s the weight of a million different expectations and quibbles, from &ldquo;make the iPad more like the Mac&rdquo; to &ldquo;let the iPad be an iPad,&rdquo; from pro hardware announcements to satisfy developers, to hints of an augmented reality revolution to satisfy those hungry and excited for the post-staring-at-screens era.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s weirdest about Apple&rsquo;s antitrust and PR problems related to the App Store is that the App Store is a side hustle for Apple. Yes it&rsquo;s earning Apple $10+ billion a year, and even for Apple that&rsquo;s significant. But it&rsquo;s not Apple&rsquo;s main business by a longshot. To my knowledge no company in history has ever gotten into antitrust hot water over a side business so comparatively small to its overall business. Apple doesn&rsquo;t need this.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the developers are wrong, but even if they are wrong, it&rsquo;s not good for Apple that they&rsquo;re so unhappy, and feel so aggrieved. It&rsquo;s not good for Apple that developers don&rsquo;t see the App Store as a platform that works in their interests.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that SVP of Software Engineering, Bertrand Serlet, sent an email in October of 2007, just three months after the iPhone was launched. In the email, Serlet outlines essentially every core feature of Apple&rsquo;s App Store &mdash; a business that brought in an estimated $64 billion in 2020. And that, more importantly, allowed the launch of countless titanic internet startups and businesses built on and taking advantage of native apps on iPhone.</p>
<p>Forty-five minutes after the email, Steve Jobs replies to Serlet and iPhone lead Scott Forstall, from his iPhone, &ldquo;Sure, as long as we can roll it all out at Macworld on Jan 15, 2008.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though the term itself hasn&rsquo;t really come up explicitly, what&rsquo;s being discussed are Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar, think of them as slightly more advanced web apps that you can &ldquo;install&rdquo; directly from your web browser onto your home screen. Google has been pushing the idea (though support for PWAs on its own platforms is a little mixed), and some companies like Microsoft and Twitter have wholeheartedly embraced PWAs.</p>
<p>Not Apple, though. There are a variety of reasons for that &mdash; ranging from genuine concern about giving web pages too much access to device hardware to the simple fact that even Apple can&rsquo;t do everything. There&rsquo;s also the suspicion that Apple is deliberately dragging its feet on support for features that make PWAs better as a way to drive developers to its App Store instead.</p>

<p>All of this is compounded by yet another Apple policy: no third-party browser engines. You can install apps like Chrome, Firefox, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and others on the iPhone &mdash; but fundamentally they&rsquo;re all just skins on top of Apple&rsquo;s WebKit engine. That means that Apple&rsquo;s decisions on what web features to support on Safari are final. If Apple were to find a way to be comfortable letting competing web browsers run their own browser engines, a lot of this tension would dissipate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Today we&rsquo;re pleased to announce that Stack Overflow is joining Prosus. Prosus is an investment and holding company, which means that the most important part of this announcement is that Stack Overflow will continue to operate independently, with the exact same team in place that has been operating it, according to the exact same plan and the exact same business practices. Don&rsquo;t expect to see major changes or awkward &ldquo;synergies&rdquo;. The business of Stack Overflow will continue to focus on Reach and Relevance, and Stack Overflow for Teams. The entire company is staying in place: we just have different owners now.</p>
<p>This is, in some ways, the best possible outcome. Stack Overflow stays independent. The company has plenty of cash on hand to expand and deliver more features and fix the old broken ones.</p>

<p>With expertise in scaling communities in high-growth markets globally, Prosus can help accelerate Stack Overflow&rsquo;s growth ambitions, with a particular focus on reaching a wider international community, while also further scaling the company&rsquo;s Teams product to position Stack Overflow at the center of product and technology development within major enterprises globally.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/01/amazon-us-customers-given-one-week-to-opt-out-of-mass-wireless-sharing"><p>Amazon customers have one week to opt out of a plan that would turn every Echo speaker and Ring security camera in the US into a shared wireless network, as part of the company&rsquo;s plan to fix connection problems for its smart home devices.</p>
<p>The proposal, called Amazon Sidewalk, involves the company&rsquo;s devices being used as a springboard to build city-wide &ldquo;mesh networks&rdquo; that help simplify the process of setting up new devices, keep them online even if they&rsquo;re out of range of home wifi, and extend the range of tracking devices such as those made by Tile.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reference/what-is-amazon-sidewalk">Mike Prospero and Ian Morris</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.tomsguide.com/reference/what-is-amazon-sidewalk"><p>As mentioned above, Sidewalk is essentially an open network. That means that any device that is Sidewalk-enabled can connect to your Sidewalk bridge. However, those devices don&rsquo;t have unfettered access to your Wi-Fi network &mdash; no one&rsquo;s going to be watching Netflix using your Wi-Fi &mdash; nor can you see what devices are connected to your Sidewalk bridge. Additionally, any information that&rsquo;s sent via Sidewalk Bridges is encrypted.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re uncomfortable with the idea of others using your network, you can opt to turn off Sidewalk. You can&rsquo;t selectively turn off Sidewalk for specific devices; rather, you can only activate or deactivate it for all Echo and Ring devices linked to your account.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is done in the settings of the Alexa app. I don&rsquo;t recall opting out or even being aware of this when setting up my Echo, but when I checked the setting today it was already disabled.</p>

underpinnings and service terms that it says will protect the
privacy and security of this bold undertaking. To be fair, the
paper is fairly comprehensive, and so far no one has pointed out
specific flaws that undermine the encryption or other safeguards
being put in place. But there are enough theoretical risks to give
users pause.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/cfihelp/status/1397649487192072211"><p>I have noticed that our regular dev lifecycle has tanked significantly since updating to 11.3. It takes up to 10 seconds to attach the debugger. If I run the app without attaching the debugger automatically it flies.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is reported as starting with macOS 11.3. I didn&rsquo;t see any problems with that version, but since updating to macOS 11.4 I&rsquo;ve seen incredible slowness testing my Mac code. Running an individual unit test used to be almost instantaneous. Now there is a delay of 10 seconds or so between launching <code>xctest</code> (i.e. when Xcode starts showing &ldquo;Testing&#8230;&rdquo;) and when the test actually begins running. Turning off &ldquo;Debug executable&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t help. Sampling the process shows that <code>xctest</code> is waiting for the <code>access()</code> call, as it tries to load my test bundle. Meanwhile, the <code>tccd</code> process pegs the CPU.</p>

<p>I guess the problem must be triggered by <em>something</em> in my project&mdash;or perhaps just its (modest though non-trivial) size&mdash;since it doesn&rsquo;t occur with a fresh project (though even that has high CPU use for <code>tccd</code>). I&rsquo;m not sure what TCC doesn&rsquo;t like. The test bundle and all the frameworks that it links to are code signed. The delay occurs on three different Macs, one of them a clean installation.</p>

<p>Another Xcode 12.5 issue: the &ldquo;Run &lsquo;Test/Class&rsquo;&rdquo; command (Command-Control-Option-U) is always disabled, even though Xcode shows the tests and I can run them by clicking the diamond.</p>

<p>Before Full Disk Access became a thing in macOS 10.15, my apps&rsquo; background agent was a command-line tool, shipped within my apps&rsquo; bundle, and launched intermittently by launchd tasks. Testing in early betas of 10.15, I could not find any way for a command-line tool to get Full Disk Access. (This may have been fixed in later versions.) Copying the design I saw in another app (Arq Backup) which had a working background agent, I spent several months replacing my command line tool with a Service Management Login Item which runs constantly.</p>

<p>It remains frustrating how it&rsquo;s mostly not documented how TCC is suppposed to work. And how, even when you figure it out, it seems to randomly fail on certain Macs until macOS is reinstalled and/or you disable SIP and delete the database.</p>

<p>SwiftUI is my favorite framework introduced in the past few years, but when it comes to debugging issues with it, it can sometimes be more complicated than I&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Fast forward to iOS 14, and Apple introduced a new widget system. While I love these widgets and actually use them constantly, they are mostly info widgets and you can&rsquo;t do much with them.

<blockquote cite="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/11/wish-list-edit-ioss-autocorrect-dictionary/">
<p>The fix seems straightforward enough: allow users to add words to iOS&rsquo;s dictionary so they can stop fighting with autocorrect. Whether this takes the form of a contextual popover menu, a section somewhere in Settings, or somewhere else entirely doesn&rsquo;t particularly matter&mdash;the important part is giving the control to users, rather than some obtuse machine-learning algorithm that already seemingly likes to replace real words with non-words.</p>
<p>Which, while we&rsquo;re at it, suggests that Apple ought to give us an option to have autocorrect <em>unlearn</em> words as well. If the system is going to act as though it knows better than the users, it should <em>actually know better</em>. Or it should let us flag words and terms that we don&rsquo;t use and remove them from the iOS dictionary at well. Let us make our mistakes, instead of having them made for us.</p>

<p>The cumbersome way Apple lets you (theoretically) access old messages is to &ldquo;scroll to the top&rdquo; of your conversation, but it&rsquo;s extremely time consuming and doesn&rsquo;t work in practice. Yesterday I tried to scroll to the &ldquo;top&rdquo; of my iMessages that were from and to my wife. After just a few minutes, my computer with 16GB of RAM started &ldquo;beach balling&rdquo; and the app froze before I could even get to messages from 6 months ago. Meanwhile, my wife tried to access our earliest messages on her iPhone 8 Plus and it was even sadder: after over 45 minutes of scrolling, she got within a year of the conversation&rsquo;s beginning and then the iMessages app crashed on her.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote cite="https://eng.uber.com/how-uber-deals-with-large-ios-app-size/"><p>In the following article we will describe how we reduced the code size of Uber&rsquo;s iOS Rider app by 23% using advanced compiler technologies. The ideas discussed herein also translated to 17% and 19% code size savings in the Uber Driver and Uber Eats iOS apps, respectively.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>High-level language and runtime features related to reference counting and memory allocation are common causes of the most frequently repeated patterns.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Generic function instantiations and closures specialized at their call sites result in highly similar, long sequences of machine instructions.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Listing 7 above shows a common idiom recommended by Swift to use the <code>try</code> expressions to deserialize JSON data and assign to properties of a class. In this example, the class <code>MyClass</code> contains 118 properties, which are initialized from a JSON object. The initialization happens via <code>try</code> expressions, which throw <code>Error</code> if the property is not found in the incoming JSON object. If any one of the try expressions fails, all the previously created properties have to be released. When this code is lowered into LLVM IR and then into the machine code, it leads into N blocks of codes where the N<sup>th</sup> block and N-1<sup>th</sup> bock have N-1 same instructions, N-1<sup>th</sup> and N-2<sup>th</sup> block have N-2 same instructions and so on &mdash; which is a O(N<sup>2</sup>) replicated code.</p></blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re contributing the work back to LLVM.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review">
<p>We might envision an ISP that smashes through the plodding local politics of digging fiber trenches by literally achieving escape velocity and delivering fast, reliable internet from the heavens above. [&#8230;] Starlink, a new satellite internet service from SpaceX, is a spectacular technical achievement that might one day do all of these things. But right now it is also very much a beta product that is unreliable, inconsistent, and foiled by even the merest suggestion of trees.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The idea of ordering a $499 dish with a $99 monthly fee that can deliver Starlink&rsquo;s current goal of 100Mbps down and 20Mbps up would indeed be a dream come true &mdash; especially since Starlink has set a long-term goal of 1Gbps down. It represents <em>competition</em>, something the American broadband market sorely lacks.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The fundamental setup is incredibly simple: you plug both Ethernet cables into the power adapter, plug that into the wall, and you&rsquo;re done. The printed instructions in the box are just pictograms, like Ikea for space internet.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Services that require a sustained, real-time connection, like Slack, Zoom, or gaming, simply weren&rsquo;t usable for me, even when I was seeing the fastest speeds. [&#8230;] Starlink&rsquo;s latency also swings from fine &mdash; Zoom did not exhibit any delay when it worked &mdash; to pretty bad.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://provscons.com/starlink-vs-hughesnet-everything-you-should-know/">
<p>HughesNet uses geosynchronous satellites to provide the internet. These satellites are 35,786km (22,236 miles) above the earth. As a result, HughesNet has a minimum of 600ms latency. Sometimes it goes up to 1200ms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Starlink uses low earth orbit satellites. These satellites are placed in 550km (340 miles) orbit above the earth. </p>
<p>Starlink regularly achieves a latency of less than 50ms. Reports show that the latency between 20ms to 40ms is typical, which is mindblowing for satellite internet.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1394038469526228992"><p>I have gotten about a dozen emails from Starlink customers who don&rsquo;t love my piece for various reasons, which is fair. The common thread? All of them <em>hate</em> their local ISPs. Here&rsquo;s just a sample.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"><p>This map shows where the broadband problem is worst &mdash; the areas where the difficulty of reliably connecting to the internet has gotten bad enough to become a drag on everyday life. Specifically, the colored-in areas show US counties where less than 15 percent of households are using the internet at broadband speed, defined as 25Mbps download speed.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Instead of the FCC&rsquo;s data, we drew on an anonymized dataset collected by Microsoft through its cloud services network, published in increments by the company over the past 18 months. If the FCC monitors the connections that providers say they&rsquo;re offering, this measures what they&rsquo;re actually getting.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote cite="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/uber-app-rewrite-yolo/"><p>The mobile platform team has been working on the project for a few months, coming up with <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs">RIBs</a>, a new architecture we&rsquo;re using for the project. For the program teams - the ones building features -, the work started a few weeks ago. We have less than 3 months: the rewrite needs to be done by 16 September. Every last screen of the old app will not only be ported, but re-imagined, UX and workflows changed.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I tell him we cannot make the deadline. Not unless we cut the scope, push back the timeline, or add more people. Ideally, all three. He says we&rsquo;ll see what we can do.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The pace of work is still excruciatingly slow. Tooling is a major issue: compiling the app from scratch takes 25-30 minutes on iOS and around 10 on Android. Landing a change to master can take hours and hours, due to to the long-running test suite, the merge conflicts thanks to the large number of changes and flakey UI tests.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>None of us know for sure what the app release strategy will be until a week before launch. Then it&rsquo;s confirmed. We&rsquo;re going YOLO.</p></blockquote>

<p>They wanted to release a combined app that included both the old and new versions, so they could do a gradual rollout, but it wouldn&rsquo;t fit under the 100 MB App Store cap for cellular downloads.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/uber-app-rewrite-yolo/">
<p>Considering the circumstances, the launch was a roaring success. Very few critical bugs were found: which was impressive, considering the YOLO release and how little time we had to test.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Helix took a huge toll on most people. A few people quit during the project, but the majority of resignation notices came after we shipped the app. Many people did not even stick around a few months for March bonuses.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to have image and RSS support, but the way it&rsquo;s done is pretty frustrating. You can&rsquo;t subscribe to the whole forum, only to individual tags. This is extra work to set up, and you&rsquo;ll miss posts if a new tag is introduced. It also means that if a post has multiple tags it will appear duplicated in your feed reader. At first it looks like there&rsquo;s no page that lists all the tags. You can only view them <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/search/?tags=all">15 at a time</a>, which is lots of pages for 561 tags. Eventually I found a link in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/forums/">forum help</a> to a page listing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/forums-tags/">all the tags</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaskarsb/status/1397879102783164419">Nearly half</a> of the main page&rsquo;s width is devoted to showing a list of only 5 trending tags. There&rsquo;s still no mailing list mode. I&rsquo;m not sure whether external links are still banned.</p>

<p>There are no RSS feed on a member&rsquo;s profile, so you can&rsquo;t <a href="https://github.com/macshome/The-Wisdom-of-Quinn">follow</a> known high-signal posters like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/profile/eskimo">Quinn</a>. He does, however, have a list of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/681081">favorite improvements</a>, mainly to the Markdown support.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want any of the new features, so I dismissed the upgrade notice. The app didn&rsquo;t nag me to upgrade again that I remember, so I kept using it with no problems, apparently for years. Until, that is, Apple released iOS 14.5, which somehow prevented Momento&mdash;now called Momento Classic&mdash;from launching. Uh oh.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>When I downloaded the current version of Momento and tried to import data from Momento Classic, I got the same error dialog as when I tried to launch Momento Classic under iOS 14.5. Presumably, the new version needs to communicate directly with the old version to import data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the downsides of iOS is the lack of flexibility to deal with situations like this. You can&rsquo;t revert your device to an earlier version of iOS. You can&rsquo;t download files from an iCloud backup. Engst was able to use a third-party app to extract the database file from a local backup, but he wasn&rsquo;t able to copy it back to the iPhone to import it into the app.</p>

<p id="extracting-data-from-an-old-ios-app-broken-by-ios-14-5-update-2021-06-05">Update (2021-06-05): <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/05/20/extracting-data-from-an-old-ios-app-broken-by-ios-14-5/">Adam Engst</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://tidbits.com/2021/05/20/extracting-data-from-an-old-ios-app-broken-by-ios-14-5/">
<p>After I published this article (but before it appeared in a TidBITS issue, after which we don&rsquo;t make changes), <a href="https://talk.tidbits.com/t/extracting-data-from-an-old-ios-app-broken-by-ios-14-5/15712/9?u=ace">Steve Nicolai left a comment</a> saying that he had solved a similar issue with an old app refusing to launch under iOS 14.5 by offloading and reloading it. Initially, I read that as deleting and reinstalling. In a test with Momento Classic on my iPhone 11 Pro, I confirmed that he was correct, but deleting the app erased its data too. Data loss aside, this was a significant step forward, since it brought a previously inaccessible app back to life in situ.</p>
<p>Then Steve set me straight. He was referring to the process of offloading an app to save space, which you do in Settings &gt; General &gt; iPhone Storage. Tap the magnifying glass icon at the top to search for the app you want, tap Offload App, tap Offload App again in the prompt, and once it has been removed from your iPhone, tap Reinstall App. When I did that with the NME Digital app, it came back to life!</p>

<p>Apple also says they conduct a &ldquo;robust&rdquo; review process - yet this fraud takes place immediately upon launching the app.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know why this API exists in the first place.

<p>A company that was actually laser focused on making &ldquo;the best AppStore&rdquo; would have thought outside the box for alternative ways of surfacing quality.</p>

<p>This is just one idea &mdash; but it highlights the unique features Apple could actually take of advantage of by controlling the &ldquo;entire experience&rdquo;. The ability to let you know that an app has a great support history would be killer for non-tech savvy users.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is that Apple is <em>hypothetically correct</em> about the advantages of top-down control. But ironically, once you start realizing all the cool things Apple could provide with their vertical integration, you notice the disconnect with the things they actually invest in.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27276238"><p>It has nothing to do with engineering resources, and we always <em>wanted</em> native context menus, but they were not customizable enough to meet the perceived needs of web, XUL, and extension developers at the time.

The native APIs put heavy limitations on what you could do with a native context menu and it was just not compatible with the expectations of people building against the rendering engine at the time.</p>
<p>There was some discussion of switching back and forth between native and non-native menus based on styling, but that got complicated quickly and it wasn&rsquo;t thought to be worthwhile.</p>

It is hard to sympathize with a developer that is suing over a single-digit percentage of its revenues because of a contract dispute that it initiated in bad faith, and where it is clear that it hopes to develop its own platform that will have similarly stringent rules. But this trial has surely put a big dent in Apple&rsquo;s reputation. If you thought before that Apple was an overly controlling corporate giant that squeezed money at every possible opportunity, its executives&rsquo; testimony reinforced that. Even if you are comfortable with Apple&rsquo;s business case, Tim Cook&rsquo;s cold remarks must have shaken some of that confidence.</p>
<p>In a little under two weeks, WWDC will begin. Like last year, I am sure Cook and Federighi are relieved they will not have to face developers in person. That would be awkward.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I updated my main Mac to Big Sur a month and a half ago, so I&rsquo;ve been using macOS 11.2.3 through 11.3.1. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not sure that it fixes any of the <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/02/09/remaining-issues-new-in-catalina/">Catalina issues</a> that I mentioned, and it introduces a variety of new ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Several times my Mac <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/05/16/big-sur-really-needs-real-free-space/">froze and then became unbootable</a> due to APFS snapshots not being pruned, so macOS ran out of disk space and couldn&rsquo;t function (despite showing hundreds of GB of free space).</p></li>

<li><p>I continue to see random freezes and breakage across the system (sandbox file access, external drives, XPC, etc.), such that reboots are necessary to get it working again. I doubt I&rsquo;ve ever had an uptime of more than 5 days, whereas prior to Catalina it was probably measured in weeks or months.</p></li>

<li><p>WebKit frequently crashes, seemingly due to a GPU issue, which it almost never did before. Same with the Quick Look process.</p></li>

<li><p>The most annoying bug, affecting me multiple times per day, is that save panels don&rsquo;t work reliably. I will save a file (typically a message or attachment from Mail) and have it end up in the wrong folder. Part of this is because the state isn&rsquo;t remembered. Multiple apps often default to the Documents folder rather than to the last used folder. But there are also glitches where the UI lies. The destination folder selected in the sidebar doesn&rsquo;t match the destination folder shown in the pop-up menu above the file list. Or the pop-up menu says one folder name but the file list below it shows the contents of a different folder. Or the pop-up menu and file list both show the desired folder, but I click Save and it creates the file in a different folder (typically Documents rather than a folder in my iCloud Drive).</p></li>

<li><p>Save panels also no longer remember the sidebar width. So, unless I keep dragging it wider, I can&rsquo;t read the longer folder names.</p></li>

<li><p>Save panels use rounded text fields for the filename and tags, whereas historically rounded fields have only been used for active fields like for searching and for posting in Messages.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether the <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/10/11/mail-data-loss-in-macos-10-15/">Mail data loss bug</a> (moving messages stored on the mail server instead deletes them) from Catalina is fixed. I have multiple reports of it happening on macOS 11.2.3 (and reproduced it myself on earlier versions of macOS 11) but I haven&rsquo;t received any reports of it on 11.3 yet. Perhaps most people who have seen the bug have either switched mail clients or are sticking with older versions of macOS. I&rsquo;ve not heard from any users who were seeing the bug before that it&rsquo;s fixed, nor has Apple said that it is. [Update (2021-05-28): I&rsquo;ve received reports of this still happening on macOS 11.3.1 and 11.4.]</p></li>

<li><p>I continue to receive tons of reports of Mail rules not reliably moving messages across accounts (either from a server account to On My Mac or between mailboxes in different server accounts). Mail shows the &ldquo;moved&rdquo; message in both the source and destination mailboxes. Sometimes the message does actually get moved on the server (i.e. Mail&rsquo;s display doesn&rsquo;t match the reality of where the message is stored); other times the message really doesn&rsquo;t move. Moving messages within the same account does seem to consistently work, if you&rsquo;re not one of the people affected by the previous item.</p></li>

<li><p>The message list&mdash;I use the Column Layout&mdash;is massively slower, with occasional delays of several seconds when clicking a message to view and almost universal sluggishness arrow keying down the message list. It helps to a lot to <a href="https://twitter.com/ccgus/status/1382726040376594434">uncheck</a> &ldquo;Highlight messages with color when not grouped,&rdquo; which is a shame because I&rsquo;ve always found that feature useful. I&rsquo;m not sure what all the other causes of slowness are. Some of it seems to be due to repeatedly querying <code>NSUserDefaults</code> (e.g. about the blocked messages settings) while drawing. But that doesn&rsquo;t explain why some messages (inconsistently) get stuck for a few seconds before loading at all.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s not just slow; after clicking on a message it will continue showing &ldquo;No Message Selected&rdquo; no matter how long I wait.</p></li>

<li><p>Mail&rsquo;s sort state is unreliable. Most obviously, the column that it&rsquo;s sorting by is often not the one where it shows the indicator caret. So it looks like the sorting is incorrect even though it isn&rsquo;t. But then other times it doesn&rsquo;t remember the sort state for a mailbox, so it&rsquo;s sorting by <em>and</em> indicating the wrong column.</p></li>

<li><p>Mail&rsquo;s scroll state is also less reliable than before, e.g. when clicking on a mailbox it will show some random scroll position rather than either the last viewed one or scrolling all the way to the top or bottom.</p></li>

<li><p>Mail continues to have data vault problems that can prevent plug-ins from being able to load after a migration or restore. (Mail incorrectly reports that they are incompatible.) Usually this can be fixed by manually <a href="https://c-command.com/spamsieve/help/resetting-mail-s-privat">deleting the data vault</a> (after turning off SIP), although sometimes even that doesn&rsquo;t help.</p></li>

<li><p>Mail recipient auto-completion would only work when typing names, not addresses. This was annoying for contacts that have multiple addresses because there was no way to quickly jump to the one that you wanted. I think this got fixed in macOS 11.3.</p></li>

<li><p>After clicking on mailbox in Mail, it continues showing the content from the previously selected mailbox while it loads, instead of either waiting with the old mailbox selected or displaying the new one blank with a spinner.</p></li>

<li><p>Unread counts of mailboxes and especially smart mailboxes continue to be unreliable. Smart mailboxes sometimes show the wrong messages entirely.</p></li>

<li><p>The Mail search query is now maintained in the search field when switching mailboxes in the sidebar. This can be useful, e.g. when doing the same search across multiple locations, but it&rsquo;s inconsistent with other apps.</p></li>

<li><p>Mail&rsquo;s &ldquo;Enable this account&rdquo; checkbox doesn&rsquo;t work for POP accounts. There&rsquo;s no way to hide and disable them.</p></li>

<li><p>In Mail&rsquo;s column layout, clicking the reply arrow icon next to message no longer shows the related messages.</p></li>

<li><p>Mail is encountering more mysterious errors that cause &ldquo;Recovered Messages&rdquo; mailboxes to be generated.</p></li>

<li><p>Moving IMAP mailboxes doesn&rsquo;t work unless the target mailbox <a href="https://twitter.com/nubero/status/1396857992885284868">is collapsed</a>. (It even fails if it&rsquo;s collapsed but springs open as you hover for too long.)</p></li>

<li><p>Mail&rsquo;s data density is much lower due to changing the way <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/03/23/apple-mails-magic-mailboxes/">magic mailboxes</a> work. It used to be that Inbox/Sent/Drafts/Archive/Trash mailboxes for all accounts could be grouped together at the top of the list. Most of the time you could work with a single combined/unified mailbox of each type, regardless of how many accounts you have. And then these other mailboxes wouldn&rsquo;t clutter the rest of the sidebar. With Mail&rsquo;s new system of favorite mailboxes, you can still see the magic mailboxes at the top, but they still appear (duplicated) in each account&rsquo;s section. So, if you have 5 accounts, you lose 25 lines in your sidebar. Even on a 27-inch display, I can no longer see all my accounts at once without scrolling.</p></li>

<li><p>Using external drives continues to be unreliable, with some not mounting until I go into Disk Utility. Erasing drives often fails. It seems to work better to format as unencrypted HFS+ first, before formatting using the actual desired format. Drives <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1393410217875021824">spontaneously unmount</a>, which hadn&rsquo;t really happened to me for the last several releases.</p></li>

<li><p>There are weird scrolling issues in different apps. For example, OmniOutliner documents always open scrolled down a few lines. Messages conversations often open scrolled up a few lines (not correlated with which messages have been read or where the conversation was previously scrolled to).</p></li>

<li><p>Opening Messages by clicking a notification doesn&rsquo;t always scroll the clicked-on message into view.</p></li>

<li><p>I really like the new window subtitle feature, but I don&rsquo;t like putting the title and toolbar buttons on the same line. There just isn&rsquo;t enough space for the buttons, especially if you like seeing them with labels.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m not yet used to the new coloring for active vs. inactive window title bars.</p></li>

<li><p>I miss being able to drag a window by its title bar while a sheet is up (e.g. while posting in MarsEdit, sampling in Activity Monitor, or sending a message in Mail).</p></li>

<li><p>I also miss being able to drag a window from any area of the title bar. Now I have to make sure I&rsquo;m not clicking on a button.</p></li>

<li><p>Window sidebars are hard to read unless I adjust the accessibility settings.</p></li>

<li><p>Dimming the text and images in the sidebars of background windows is causing problems for me. First, this makes it harder to interact with background windows, e.g. finding the right folder to drop onto. Second, it&rsquo;s inconsistent&mdash;sometimes a background window doesn&rsquo;t get dimmed, which again makes it harder to tell which window is frontmost. As far as I know, there&rsquo;s no API for apps to tell when to dim their sidebars, so (depending on the app) this can take extra work for developers and again there is inconsistency.</p></li>

<li><p>I continue to see window layer and drawing glitches, where a window&rsquo;s chrome disappears, or everything but the shadow disappears, or a whole group of windows have their shadows flash on and off while I&rsquo;m in another app. Sometimes the Dock itself flashes on and off.</p></li>

<li><p>There are drawing glitches like large <a href="https://twitter.com/nickheer/status/1383130885625552897">red rectangles</a> when viewing JPEGs or blue ones when viewing PDFs.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s no longer possible to drag a window right up to the menu bar or Dock. There is always a line of colored pixels in between, the desktop picture showing through.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes when I drag a window from a Retina display to a non-Retina one the font smoothing gets extra blurry.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes Night Shift only works on one of my displays (the internal).</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes Notification Center doesn&rsquo;t show any notifications.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes all the widgets disappear and I have to manually re-add and configure them.</p></li>

<li><p>The Stocks and Weather widgets are <a href="https://twitter.com/mjtsai/status/1375086623759683590">much worse</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes the menu bar clock is drawn faded out, even when Do Not Disturb is not enabled. Or, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure, maybe Do Not Disturb is actually in effect even though it isn&rsquo;t supposed to be, and it won&rsquo;t actually turn off.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s forgetful of privacy preferences and sometimes spontaneously logs me out when I open the privacy section of System Preferences.</p></li>

<li><p>It still forgets my desktop pictures, but only for some spaces.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes switching to an app switches to the wrong space, i.e. a space that has no windows for that app at all.</p></li>

<li><p>Revealing files in Finder (either through another app&rsquo;s menu command or the Command-click menu in a window&rsquo;s title bar) often fails and instead opens a window showing just the home folder.</p></li>

<li><p>Finder shows files whose name ends with <tt>.mbox</tt> using a folder icon.</p></li>

<li><p>Finder sometimes reports a nonsensical error when I try to move a file to iCloud Drive. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem with iCloud, since I can AirDrop the file to another Mac or to my iPhone and use that to save it to iCloud Drive.</p></li>

<li><p>Finder often shows a multi-second Gatekeeper progress bar when opening a regular document, even one that had been created on my own Mac and was never downloaded from the Internet.</p></li>

<li><p>Finder sometimes shows very stale folder contents, e.g. showing files in their previous folder long after they&rsquo;ve been moved. Or not showing new files long after they&rsquo;ve finished being saved. Or showing Safari download progress files long after the download has completed.</p></li>

<li><p>Other times the entire contents of a folder disappear for 30 seconds or so, making it look like my files have been deleted even though they were not actually touched.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes dragging a selection of multiple files doesn&rsquo;t do anything. They have to be dragged individually.</p></li>

<li><p>Dragging and dropping files into the Time Machine exclusions list doesn&rsquo;t work. (Workaround: click the + button and drag into the open panel.)</p></li>

<li><p>The Documents folder now shows some folders that are actually stored in app sandbox containers. I&rsquo;m used to this folder being <em>my</em> area to organize.</p></li>

<li><p>Image Capture forgets the destination folder for saving photos. I have to choose it again each time.</p></li>

<li><p>Image Capture won&rsquo;t auto-delete photos after copying them. (The &ldquo;Delete after import&rdquo; checkbox has been removed from the sidebar but is still available if you add the &ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo; button to the toolbar. It just doesn&rsquo;t seem to do anything. Note that there is no View menu command to customize the toolbar; you have to know to Control-click on it.)</p></li>

<li><p>I like the new translation feature in Safari, but it turns out that I usually want to translate text that&rsquo;s on the clipboard, not on a Web page. Why is there no Translate app like on iOS? Wasn&rsquo;t Catalyst supposed to help with cases like this?</p></li>

<li><p>If I cut the URL in Safari&rsquo;s location bar and then switch to another tab, the field remains blank. To see the URL for the new tab I have to reload the page.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/05/04/script-debugger-8/">AppleScript</a> doesn&rsquo;t properly work with Rosetta.</p></li>

<li><p>There are various problems with the Bluetooth APIs: connections time out instead of succeeding and connection observers aren&rsquo;t always notified.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s now possible to remove the Spotlight menu, but I don&rsquo;t see a way to get it back. [Update (2021-05-24): <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/05/24/remaining-issues-in-big-sur/#comment-3459762">It&rsquo;s in</a> the redesigned Dock &amp; Menu Bar preferences.

<p>This is the longest I have ever waited to upgrade macOS. It feels weird, considering WWDC is next week where we will see what is next for macOS. Big Sur still feels new to me, and announcing the next major release already feels too soon. I was avoiding Big Sur based on various reports about bugs and instability. There were not any &lsquo;killer&rsquo; features I was eager to have, thus the main reason I upgraded was because Xcode 12.5 required it.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/tim-cook-apple-epic-trial"><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook took the stand on Friday for the final day of testimony in the Epic v. Apple antitrust trial.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>&ldquo;When they buy an iPhone today, they buy something that just works. I think they buy into a total ecosystem when they buy an iPhone,&rdquo; Cook said. Bornstein presented Cook with the notion that Apple has no idea if it&rsquo;s more dangerous to open up the iOS ecosystem because it has not once allowed it in the iPhone&rsquo;s nearly 15 years of existence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an experiment I wouldn&rsquo;t want to run,&rdquo; Cook replied. Cook said his assertion that a more open IOS would be &ldquo;terrible for the user&rdquo; to be based on his &ldquo;business judgment.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-epic-apple-trial/"><p>Cook was asked if third-party companies could implement app review as effectively as Apple, and Cook said no.</p><blockquote><p>They&rsquo;re not as motivated as Apple is. For us, the customer is everything. We&rsquo;re trying to give the customer an integrated solution of hardware, software, and services. We deliver a brand of privacy, security, and safety. I just don&rsquo;t think you can replicate that in a third-party.</p></blockquote><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Judge Rogers engaged Cook in a long debate about in-app purchases and how they&rsquo;re driven by games. Rogers is curious what&rsquo;s wrong with Apple providing users with choice within in-app purchases. If people want to buy v-bucks separately, what&rsquo;s the issue with Apple giving them that option? Or telling them they can make the choice?</p><p>Cook said that if people were allowed to link out, Apple would &ldquo;in essence give up [its] total return on [its] IP. The judge then pointed out that games make up most of the in-app purchases. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as if they&rsquo;re subsidizing everybody else,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;We need a return on our IP,&rdquo; said Cook. &ldquo;We have 150,000 APIs to create and maintain, numerous developer tools, and processing fees.&rdquo;</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Do all developers like things the way they are? asked the lawyer. &ldquo;Some developers don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said Cook, referencing  Epic Games .

Customers would then have to post their credit cards in all these different apps.

IAP is the most &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; way to do it, Cook says.</p></blockquote>

<p>Apple Pay already prevents customers from having to enter their credit cards, and it gives Apple a commission, but Apple forbids its use in cases where it requires IAP.</p>

<p>Cook used more privacy and safety claims to defend that system, saying it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separately. He was also, however, a little blunter about Apple&rsquo;s own interests. &ldquo;IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission&rdquo; &mdash; for payment processing, but also customer service and the use of Apple&rsquo;s intellectual property. Without in-app purchases, &ldquo;we would have to come up with another system to invoice developers, which I think would be a mess.&rdquo; If Apple let developers tell users about other payment methods, Cook said later, &ldquo;we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/tim-cook-apple-epic-grilled"><p>The end result was the best hint yet how Gonzalez Rogers is thinking about the Fortnite dispute, which one of Epic&rsquo;s many complaints she finds credible and how she may decide to rule when the trial ends. In particular, the judge seems concerned about the rigidness of the 30% cut and Apple&rsquo;s rules against allowing developers to communicate ways to purchase digital goods off-platform.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The general takeaway is that Gonzalez Rogers expressed deep skepticism of Apple&rsquo;s claims that it operates the App Store the way it does out of the goodness of its heart. Apple executives have reiterated throughout the trial that they built iOS and the App Store this way out of concern for user security and privacy and for an end-to-end experience. But Gonzalez Rogers says there were also clear financial incentives to do so and that it appears Apple is incapable of responding to any concerns that may threaten the benefits it receives.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://www.fosspatents.com/2021/05/friday-for-fortnite.html"><p>Getting back to the first trial week, its second half actually went better for Epic than some observers realized. Not only did Judge Gonzalez Rogers identify some inconsistencies and a certain degree of arbitrariness in Apple&rsquo;s app review decisions but she also made a remark on how competition spurs innovation, which in turn improves security.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>As a complainant whose problem with Apple relates to its inherently-subjective Objectionable Content guideline, I don&rsquo;t see how the problem could be solved without third-party app stores like the Epic Games Store. The 30% could be undercut and undermined in other ways. But for developers to regain some essential freedoms we had in the past, when the primary platform was Windows followed by the Mac and Linux, it takes more than an &ldquo;anti-anti-steering&rdquo; order, though it was another key moment when Judge YGR indicated she wasn&rsquo;t going to buy Apple&rsquo;s American Express analogy (that case was about an anti-steering provision).</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=5465">Rob Griffiths</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=5465">
<p>In theory, upgraders and new customers for a new release funded all the work we did between initial release and the major update. In reality, that model is broken for us&mdash;and for you, our customers&mdash;and it&rsquo;s been broken for quite a few years.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>A related issue is the amount of other work we have to do for free; there&rsquo;s no way with our current model to ever cover the time we put into updating for new macOS features, or to work around bugs in other apps that cause problems in our apps, etc. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not happy (no new features) and we&rsquo;re not happy (stressful, no revenue stream). Clearly the model had to change. So we changed it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>At the end of the full year, you&rsquo;ll own the latest version released during that year, and you can keep using it without any sort of restrictions. It&rsquo;s your app, and it won&rsquo;t stop working just because a year has passed. At some point, if you want to update to the latest version, you can do so by paying a much lower &ldquo;update only&rdquo; price&mdash;and that price also includes at least one more full year of updates.</p>
<p>This is not a subscription in any way. You own the app, and you decide when (and even if) you want to add features we&rsquo;ve added to the app over the time since your original year of updates passed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like they are keeping initial prices the same and offering a year of updates for 50% off. So, for a customer who wants to always be current, this represents a price increase vs. the old model of up to 9 years between major upgrades. But, as popularized by Sketch, it&rsquo;s a good compromise vs. subscriptions in that you&rsquo;re not renting the app and are never forced to upgrade. In theory, you can get access to new features sooner because they don&rsquo;t need to be held for business reasons. And the predictable schedule has benefits for both sides. For the customer, there&rsquo;s not really a bad time to buy. For the developer, as long as you keep making good updates you can get smoother revenue.</p>

<p><a href="https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=5465">Rob Griffiths</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=5465"><p>[The] App Store doesn&rsquo;t support anything like what we&rsquo;re trying to do. Thankfully, we don&rsquo;t have to answer it right away, as our App Store apps aren&rsquo;t up for major updates right now. (Moom 4, which will be our next major update, won&rsquo;t be in the App Store, because it&rsquo;s not allowed under their rules. It&rsquo;s only there today because Apple allowed the current version to stay when they changed the rules.)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-4">Benjamin Schaaf</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-4">
<p>Sublime Text license keys are no longer tied to a single major version, instead they are now valid for all updates within 3 years of purchase. After that, you will still have full access to every version of Sublime Text released within the 3 year window, but newer builds will required a license <a href="https://sublimehq.com/store/upgrade">upgrade</a>. These are the same license terms we use for <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>, and they allow us to deliver more frequent and exciting updates as soon as they're ready, without having to roll them into a new major version.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with Objective-C, you likely know about selectors, but they only contain the name and number of parameters. The type each parameter has is stored in the method type encoding, which is encoded as a simple string. With C++ types, those strings can easily become lengthy and add to your binary size. [&#8230;] Before it was changed, the worst offending method type signature in our codebase contained 13,126 characters. That&rsquo;s 12 KB (!) for one type.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>While you can use <code>strings Foo.app/Foo | grep -e '{'</code> in your app binary to find encodings, it&rsquo;s not always easy to see the method or variable referenced. So instead, I wrote a helper in Swift to find the largest type encodings of methods and instance variables.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>There are various ways you can hide C++ objects. For most situations, I created a separate struct in the ObjC class implementation and moved C++ objects into it. This newly created struct is connected to the class via a <code>unique_ptr</code>. This is an additional level of indirection, but it can be cached before entering any hot paths, so it shouldn&rsquo;t have any performance drawbacks (see below).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/apples-craig-federighi-admits-macos-malware-level-is-not-acceptable">Nick Statt</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1395032968830259200">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/apples-craig-federighi-admits-macos-malware-level-is-not-acceptable"><p>Epic and its lawyers have throughout the trial pointed to the freedom consumers have on macOS to download applications outside the Mac App Store and to largely do what they please on the macOS operating system. Epic has held up the openness of the Mac as an example of what the iPhone, as a general computing device in Epic&rsquo;s eyes, should be transitioned into if it were to win its case.</p><p>But Federighi on Wednesday argued against this proposition by saying it would destroy the level of security enjoyed by iOS users, in effect tarnishing the Mac in order to save the iPhone. &ldquo;It would become commonplace for users to be directed to download misrepresented software from untrusted sources where they&rsquo;d be subject to malware,&rdquo; Federighi argued, referring to the notion of alternative app stores as a &ldquo;pretty devastating setback for iOS security.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security">Adi Robertson</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1395029579484606464">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"><p>Federighi basically says iOS users need to be more protected because the Mac is a specialist tool for people who know how to navigate the complexities of a powerful system, while the iPhone and iPad are &mdash; literally &mdash; for babies.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Federighi took a far broader view of security than Epic&rsquo;s own expert witness James Mickens. Mickens testified earlier that iOS wasn&rsquo;t meaningfully more secure than Android, but he analyzed mostly technical threats to the platforms. Federighi focused on scams, phishing, and other apps that target human psychology instead of computer code &mdash; many of which pose serious dangers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the protectiveness felt patronizing. When Federighi explained Apple&rsquo;s restrictions on cloud gaming, he focused partly on tangible security issues, like how to grant device permissions for different titles on a single gaming app. But he slipped seamlessly into discussing how the concept would be simply too confusing &mdash; that iPhone and iPad owners would be befuddled by the notion of launching a separate game catalog. Apple wants iOS devices to feel trustworthy, but at times like that, it seems more like Apple just doesn&rsquo;t trust its own users.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic">
<p>Federighi&rsquo;s mission was pretty clear from the outset: to extol the security benefits that come with iOS&rsquo;s walled-off ecosystem and warn of the dangers that would come with breaking the App Store model.</p>
<p>But in building that argument, Federighi also made some surprisingly blunt concessions about security on macOS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,&rdquo; Federighi said in the testimony. &ldquo;And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don&rsquo;t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Federighi also cast the difference between the two platforms in unusual terms, describing the desktop platform as something akin to a car. &ldquo;If operated correctly, much like that car, if you know how to operate a car and obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes,&rdquo; he said when asked directly whether macOS is safe. &ldquo;If not, I&rsquo;ve had a couple of family members who have gotten some malware on their Macs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.imore.com/craig-federighi-defends-iphone-security-throwing-mac-under-bus"><p>It&rsquo;s kind of insane to know that Apple&rsquo;s strategy to protect the App Store on the iPhone requires it to throw the Mac under the bus. Federighi&rsquo;s reasoning is that the iPhone, being that it contains more private information and is carried around with you, requires a higher bar of security.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/logancollins/status/1395110456864301058"><p>It&rsquo;s hard not to read into this as Federighi saying &ldquo;we see the Mac as a malware-ridden mess and will change that by locking out everyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with us.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442395/at-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean"><p>&ldquo;Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects,&rdquo; Schiller explained. Different parts of Apple simply aren&rsquo;t siloed into neat divisions; it&rsquo;s one tight-knit company that makes a many-featured product.</p>
<p>That anecdote buttressed a more legally pertinent claim: because of this management system, Apple allegedly has no idea how much the App Store makes.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Where Epic has pointed out phrases like &ldquo;lock-in&rdquo; and seeking &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; on iOS, Schiller emphasized that the &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; involved trying to add features that would discourage phishing. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any plan here, it&rsquo;s simply to come up with new features to help protect users from security and privacy scams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Cross-examination touched on topics like iMessage, but Epic&rsquo;s counsel favored exhaustive readings of policies and lists that could show Apple in an unfavorable light, including every time it mentions relying on open source software and the search results for &ldquo;BDSM&rdquo; on the App Store.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/apple-epic-fortnite-commisions">Nick Statt</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1394667326663020550">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/apple-epic-fortnite-commisions"><p>Schmid was likely far underplaying the amount of revenue Apple earned from Fortnite&rsquo;s mobile app, as court documents and independent analyst firms estimate the amount to be more in the range of $300 million to $350 million. It&rsquo;s unclear why Schmid chose the $100 million figure when asked how much money Apple earned on commission from Fortnite through the App Store&rsquo;s standard 30% cut.</p></blockquote>

<p>Epic&rsquo;s attorney raises one case of a company that had to remove in-app purchases of a sort: Amazon. Schiller says Amazon launched a store specifically to sell Kindle ebooks, because &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t expect anyone to read books on an iPhone.&rdquo; So it was considered an external purchase.</p>
<p>Amazon added support for reading ebooks within iOS, and Apple said Amazon had to either remove it and force people to only read on the Kindle again, or start giving Apple a commission on what had become an in-app purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really agree with that narrative, given the sequence of events:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-application-iphone-and-ipod-touch-now-available-apple">December 2008</a>: Amazon introduces the Amazon.com app, which lets you make purchases from an iPhone.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/03/amazon-launches-kindle-app-for-the-iphone/">March 2009</a>: Amazon introduces the free Kindle app, which allows reading books on an iPhone.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_3">June 2009</a>: Apple introduces In-App Purchase with iOS 3. It is <a href="https://marco.org/2009/06/20/the-economics-of-in-app-purchase">restricted to paid apps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/15/apple-announces-in-app-purchases-for-free-iphone-applications/">October 2009</a>: Apple allows free apps to use IAP.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2010/04/06/ibooks-and-private-apis/">April 2010</a>: Apple introduces iBooks, which takes advantage of <a href="https://marco.org/2010/04/06/ibooks-and-private-apis">private APIs</a> both for reading and for purchasing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/01/31/1984/">February 2011</a>: Apple starts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html">telling developers</a> that &ldquo;from now on&rdquo; they can no longer sell e-books <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/02/04/in-app-purchase-and-rent-seeking/">except using IAP</a>. They suddenly owe Apple 30%, which in many cases is <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/02/15/app-store-subscriptions/">more than their margin</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2011/02/01/apple-responds-to-sony-in-app-purchase-report/">claims</a> that this was the rule all along. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/02/21/implementing-in-app-purchase/">not technically practical</a> for Kindle content to use IAP, even if Amazon wanted to.</p></li>
<li><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/05/11/iflowreader-evicted-from-the-app-store/">May 2011</a>: iFlowReader goes out of business after three years of selling e-books without IAP because the new rule is &ldquo;financially impossible.&rdquo;</li>
<li><p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/07/25/kindle-app-update/">July 2011</a>: Amazon is forced to remove the link from its Kindle app that let customers purchase e-books in Safari.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2012/03/01/ibookstore-rejects-book-for-linking-to-amazon/">March 2012</a>: Apple starts rejecting e-book submissions to iBooks for including Web links to Amazon.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2013/08/27/purchasing-from-the-kindle-app/">August 2013</a>: It&rsquo;s revealed that Phil Schiller was concerned that Kindle content made it easier to switch to Android and that Steve Jobs suggested forcing Amazon to use IAP. This was in 2010, i.e. 18 months <em>after</em> the Kindle reader app had shipped.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/07/29/tim-cooks-app-store-testimony/">July 2020</a>: Tim Cook tells Congress: &ldquo;In the more than a decade since the App Store debuted, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee&rdquo; and that Apple has to follow the same rules for its apps as developers do.</p></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">Jack Nicas, Raymond Zhong, and Daisuke Wakabayashi</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/jacknicas/status/1394378309325230080">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html"><p>Tim Cook, Apple&rsquo;s chief executive, has said the data is safe. But at the data center in Guiyang, which Apple hoped would be completed by next month, and another in the Inner Mongolia region, Apple has largely ceded control to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Chinese state employees physically manage the computers. Apple abandoned the encryption technology it used elsewhere after China would not allow it. And the digital keys that unlock information on those computers are stored in the data centers they&rsquo;re meant to secure.</p>
<p>Internal Apple documents reviewed by The New York Times, interviews with 17 current and former Apple employees and four security experts, and new filings made in a court case in the United States last week provide rare insight into the compromises Mr. Cook has made to do business in China. They offer an extensive inside look &mdash; many aspects of which have never been reported before &mdash; at how Apple has given in to escalating demands from the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Mr. Cook often talks about Apple&rsquo;s commitment to civil liberties and privacy. But to stay on the right side of Chinese regulators, his company has put the data of its Chinese customers at risk and has aided government censorship in the Chinese version of its App Store. After Chinese employees complained, it even dropped the &ldquo;Designed by Apple in California&rdquo; slogan from the backs of iPhones.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1394453023234170881">
<p>The journey this slogan has taken under Tim Cook is incredible: from inheriting it as a subtle and classy message under box flaps, to clumsily pushing it to the forefront as tasteless over-branding, only to be sacrificed as a representation of complete capitulation to China.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">Nicas et al.</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">
<p>U.S. law has long prohibited American companies from turning over data to Chinese law enforcement.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In China, Apple has ceded legal ownership of its customers&rsquo; data to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, or GCBD, a company owned by the government of Guizhou Province, whose capital is Guiyang. Apple recently required its Chinese customers to accept new iCloud terms and conditions that list GCBD as the service provider and Apple as &ldquo;an additional party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The terms and conditions included a new provision that does not appear in other countries: &ldquo;Apple and GCBD will have access to all data that you store on this service&rdquo; and can share that data &ldquo;between each other under applicable law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the new setup, Chinese authorities ask GCBD &mdash; not Apple &mdash; for Apple customers&rsquo; data, Apple said. Apple believes that gives it a legal shield from American law[&#8230;]</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1394391067135447044">Matthew Green</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1394391067135447044"><p>Big parts of iCloud rely on special devices called Hardware Security Modules, or HSMs. These are specialized computers that store keys. In the US, Apple uses Thales HSMs.</p>
<p>Not only is Apple being forced to move Chinese citizens&rsquo; HSMs to China, China specifically refused to certify the Thales HSMs. This is actually pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to know what to make of this. There are two good theories:</p>
<ol><li>China does not trust western HSM hardware to keep them safe.</li>
<li>China felt the Thales HSMs were <em>too</em> safe, ie they would be difficult to for China to access.</li></ol>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this change is that (to the best of my knowledge) your iCloud country registration can be changed by anyone who has your iCloud password.</p>
<p>What happens to my data if someone changes my registration to China?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/jacknicas/status/1394378346717450243"><p>Here is Apple&rsquo;s full statement on our story. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimothyBuckSF/status/1394392205360467970">Timothy Buck</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://daringfireball.net/2021/05/nyt_apple_china_icloud"><p>Option A: Apple does what it did&#x2009;&mdash;&#x2009;store all Chinese users&rsquo; iCloud data on servers in China, under the ultimate control of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Option B: Apple refuses to do so, and the Chinese government shuts down iCloud in China and probably bans the sale of Apple devices.</p>
<p>Is there an Option C? I don&rsquo;t think there is.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose the argument for Option B is that if enough companies did this together that might put pressure on the Chinese government and eventually lead to positive change. Whereas, by bending to the demands, Apple is helping to keep the regime in power.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that Option B would &ldquo;work.&rdquo; It would have disastrous consequenes for Apple&rsquo;s sales, and possibly for its supply chain, and, at least in the short term, for its Chinese customers:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://daringfireball.net/2021/05/nyt_apple_china_icloud"><p>What would I want Apple to do if I were a Chinese citizen who wants to use an iPhone and iCloud? (And if I were a Chinese citizen, I would very much want to use an iPhone and iCloud.) [&#8230;] Even with the multiple significant compromises Apple has made to comply with Chinese law, it feels entirely possible that using Apple devices and iCloud is one of the <em>most private things</em> anyone outside government leadership can do in China.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-china-data-centres-nyt/"><p>If Apple were not involved in hardware <em>and</em> software <em>and</em> services, it would have less complicity but, also, less potential influence. It looks like that balance is tipping in the direction of this combination being a liability in the country.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s a very clear and obvious Option C &mdash; build Apple products that are less reliant on iCloud.</p>
<p>If access to the physical servers is the biggest privacy issue, then give users the tools to effectively opt-out of it entirely and take control of their own data.</p>

<p>iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive, Notes, and any other service that syncs or stores data in iCloud could be stored locally on a Time Capsule. Apple&rsquo;s servers would just be there to tell the device I&rsquo;m using how to connect to the Time Capsule on my home network. In other words, Apple facilitates the connection and then my devices talk directly with the Time Capsule using end-to-end encryption.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/05/17/how-m1-macs-feel-faster-than-intel-models-its-about-qos/">
<p>Benchmarks are all very well, but one almost universal comment made about M1 Macs is how much faster they feel, even when performance measurements don&rsquo;t show as big a difference as we might like. One very effective way of giving a good impression of speed is to segregate macOS and user software to use different cores in the way that the M1 does.</p>
<p>Few events give a worse impression to the user than the interface slowing down in the face of a problem in the operating system. We&rsquo;ve all experienced it: this could be a rogue mdworker process which keeps crashing and restarting, or anything which causes macOS to choke. Because those processes are handed over to the Efficiency cores, all they do now is slow other macOS background tasks, to which we&rsquo;re much less sensitive.</p>
<p>The Time Machine backup pictured above ran ridiculously slowly, taking over 15 minutes to back up less than 1 GB of files. Had I not been watching it in Activity Monitor, I would have been completely unaware of its poor performance. Because Macs with Intel processors can&rsquo;t segregate their tasks onto different cores in the same way, when macOS starts to choke on something it affects user processes too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a result of having efficiency vs. performance cores. macOS <em>could</em> have designated several of the identical Intel cores to be used for lower priority system tasks, leaving the other cores free for user tasks. My guess is that Apple&rsquo;s real aim was battery life, and so it made sense to add task segregation once Macs were available with efficiency cores. The improved responsiveness is more of a bonus.</p>
<p>Of course, &ldquo;magic&rdquo; features like this can sometimes do the user wrong. Most of the time, I don&rsquo;t care how long Time Machine takes, so if it can use less power and make my other apps more responsive, that&rsquo;s great. But Time Machine is <em>already</em> slow, and sometimes I have to wait for it when packing up to leave my office. In such cases, I would like it to use all the performance cores and go as fast as possible. Likewise with indexing-type tasks. Sometimes I want them in the background, not disturbing anything, but sometimes I&rsquo;m importing a big batch of photos or PDFs and want to be able to work with them ASAP.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/macbook-pro-64gb-ram-summer-2021/">Joe Rossignol</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/macbook-pro-64gb-ram-summer-2021/">
<p>Apple plans to launch new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with an improved iteration of the M1 chip as early as this summer, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"><em>Bloomberg</em>&rsquo;s Mark Gurman</a>. The new chip is said to include a 10-core CPU with eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, with 16-core or 32-core GPU options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If true, it will be interesting to see whether system tasks are now confined to only two cores, instead of four, which would make them slower than on the initial M1 Macs.</p>

The year, month, and day come from the date string, but the hour, minute, and second default to 0.  In Brazil, daylight saving time starts at midnight, and thus the date components <code>year: 2018, month: 11, day: 4, hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0</code> don&rsquo;t exist in the S&atilde;o Paulo time zone.

<p>It&rsquo;s not documented exactly what this does, but I presume that missing date components get taken from the <code>defaultDate</code>. This still makes me a bit nervous, though, because what if I have an unlucky default date whose time produces a date that doesn&rsquo;t exist in that time zone? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24088730/why-nsdateformatter-is-returning-null-for-a-19-10-2014-in-a-brazilian-time-zone">Apparently</a>, the <code>isLenient</code> property can help with that.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"><p>The Steve Jobs line that Epic has touted &mdash; &rdquo;We don&rsquo;t intend to make money off the App Store&rdquo; &mdash; comes from these early days. At the time of this announcement, Apple didn&rsquo;t know if it would make money, Schiller testified. He also suggests that the line was not a promise that Apple would <em>not </em>make money. The App Store was a &ldquo;huge&rdquo; risk, Schiller said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking our hot new product and putting something we&rsquo;ve never done before on it, and we have no apps yet! So we have no idea how this is going to do.&rdquo; This is credible. What is less convincing is Schiller&rsquo;s attempt to redefine what it means to &ldquo;lock customers into our ecosystem,&rdquo; a phrase that comes from a Jobs email entered into evidence earlier in the trial. </p><p>Look, &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; has an accepted meaning, and it&rsquo;s not a very friendly one: prisoners, for example, are locked in. Schiller gives this the old college try anyhow, telling the court that the idea behind &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; was just to make services more attractive, so that customers wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Despite Schiller&rsquo;s friendly demeanor, some of his testimony is a stretch. For instance, he says he doesn&rsquo;t see mobile as a duopoly. He lists Samsung, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon as competition. The Amazon Fire phone was discontinued in 2015, as was the Windows Phone.</p></blockquote>

Apple wanted to charge $99 for the  App Store  developer program to prove that an app that&rsquo;s being worked on is &ldquo;important&rdquo; and that developers are &ldquo;serious about making a quality app.&rdquo;</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>On the topic of physical goods, Schiller said that in 2019, the  App Store  drove $400 billion+ in transactions like food delivery, Amazon purchases, Uber, and more, which are not subject to a 30 percent cut. According to Schiller, Apple does not take a cut of physical purchases because Apple can&rsquo;t guarantee they will actually arrive.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense to count purchases using the Amazon app as being <a href="https://twitter.com/OluseyiSonaiya/status/1394378323590066176">driven</a> by iPhone.

Apple Music subscribers will also be able to listen to more than 75 million songs in Lossless Audio &mdash; the way the artists created them in the studio. These new features will be available for Apple Music subscribers starting next month at no additional cost.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>By default, Apple Music will automatically play Dolby Atmos tracks on all AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, as well as the built-in speakers in the latest versions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Apple uses ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) to preserve every single bit of the original audio file. This means Apple Music subscribers will be able to hear the exact same thing that the artists created in the studio.</p><p>To start listening to Lossless Audio, subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music can turn it on in Settings &gt; Music &gt; Audio Quality. Here, they can choose different resolutions for different connections such as cellular, Wi-Fi, or for download.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-music-spatial-lossless/"><p>If you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to the rumour mill, you might have expected that Apple would add lossless and spatial audio. The surprise is that it will be included with subscriptions at no extra cost, and that is a bold move. Spotify has not announced pricing yet for its lossless tier, but it costs $5 more per month to add lossless audio to a Deezer subscription, and it is a $10 per month add-on with Tidal, which is <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/tidal">oddly now owned by Square</a>.

In the process, BuzzFeed News found nearly a dozen Biden family members and mapped out a social web that encompasses not only the first family, but a wide network of people around them, including the president&rsquo;s children, grandchildren, senior White House officials, and all of their contacts on Venmo.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>While many critics have focused on how the app makes all transactions <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/venmo-public-feed-is-bad-and-they-should-end-it">public by default</a>, Venmo&rsquo;s friend lists are arguably a larger privacy issue. Even if a Venmo account is set to make payments private, its friend list remains exposed. There is no setting to make this information private, which means it can provide a window into someone&rsquo;s personal life that could be exploited by anyone &mdash; including trolls, stalkers, police, and spies.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Using public friend lists and transaction feeds, BuzzFeed News found two members of Congress who were roommates in Washington, DC, as well as reporters who were on friend lists with Trump administration officials, potentially exposing their sources. BuzzFeed News has also spoken with survivors of domestic violence and abuse who suspected that former partners used Venmo to track them and therapists who use Venmo to receive payment from clients and were unaware their friend lists showed who they were working with.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"><p>Massively popular game creation tool Roblox is now a massively popular <em>experience</em> creation tool Roblox, possibly in response to the ongoing Epic v. Apple trial.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Games&rdquo; tab now reads &ldquo;Discover&rdquo; on the web, although it still points to an address of &ldquo;roblox.com/games.&rdquo; Developers can create and manage &ldquo;experiences,&rdquo; and experiences have &ldquo;max people&rdquo; allowed. The word &ldquo;game&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;experience&rdquo; across nearly the entire Roblox website, and the iOS and Android apps now have a Discover tab instead of a Games tab &mdash; although both apps are currently classed as games in their respective stores.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Roblox blurs the line between a large social game and a game engine or sales platform. Users don&rsquo;t enter a single virtual world like Second Life; they launch individual experiences created by users. Developers can sell items within those experiences, and there are <a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/z3xn4e/how-these-developers-hope-to-build-a-100-person-game-studio-inside-roblox">full-fledged game studios</a> that build with Roblox instead of, say, the Unity or Unreal engines. But all of this activity happens within a single Roblox app, instead of as a series of separately packaged games.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435319/epic-apple-fortnite-trial-antitrust-candy-crush-pc-mobile">
<p>On the stand is Lorin Hitt, professor of operations, information, and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton, looking uncomfortable behind his face shield. During his direct examination in the ongoing Epic v. Apple trial, Hitt testified that he didn&rsquo;t think having to access an app like Candy Crush through a browser instead of the app counted as &ldquo;friction&rdquo; for the user &mdash; and that it certainly was less friction than &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; alternatives, such as leaving a convenience store and then crossing the street to go to another convenience store.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The app developer pages suggest they are not available on PC, despite Hitt&rsquo;s document to the contrary.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Now, Even raises the &ldquo;frictionless&rdquo; process that Hitt had blithely testified to earlier in the day. Candy Crush Saga is the example Even chooses. We go to the website, and press &ldquo;install,&rdquo; where we are promptly sent to the App Store. We tab back to the website. The only possible way to play on the web is on desktop.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We try another game, Clash Royale, developed by Supercell. We go to Supercell&rsquo;s FAQ, where it emerges that payment processes are only through Apple&rsquo;s App Store or Google play. Supercell itself doesn&rsquo;t keep payment information &ldquo;And yet you believe that your team managed to go into a website and buy legitimate Clash Royale money and go back to the app? That&rsquo;s your testimony?&rdquo; Even asks.</p>

At least five of those companies received thousands of Uyghur and other minority workers at specific factory sites or subsidiaries that did work for Apple, the investigation found.</p><p>The revelation stands in contrast to Apple&rsquo;s assertions over the past year that it hasn&rsquo;t found evidence of forced labor in its supply chain.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/04/28/that-macos-update-has-caused-havoc-what-do-i-do-next/">Howard Oakley</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/04/28/that-macos-update-has-caused-havoc-what-do-i-do-next/"><p>Many of us have just installed the largest macOS update ever released by Apple (as far as I can tell), and there&rsquo;s a few Macs which haven&rsquo;t fared well.</p></blockquote>
<p>My iMac died while making a copy of the macOS 11.3 installer, before I actually installed it. The spinning beachball showed up, and the Mac became completely unresponsive except for being able to move the cursor. I couldn&rsquo;t even <code>ssh</code> in. After a few minutes, the display went black. I eventually had to power it off and start it up again, but it got stuck halfway through the boot progress bar, the one that shows the desktop picture. I assume the CPU use was high because the fan got very loud. Eventually it seemed to kernel panic and stopped. Several <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/147375/macbook-pro-kernel-panic-at-boot">more attempts</a> at booting all failed in the same way.</p>
<p>Safe Mode, resetting the PRAM, Apple Diagnostics&mdash;none of the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200553">normal stuff</a> helped. I was able to boot from macOS Recovery as well as a clone. What if this were an M1 Mac that couldn&rsquo;t boot from a clone? Would I be able to easily sync my files to another Mac while booted from Recovery? Of course, <code>git</code> is not available, so I couldn&rsquo;t push my work in progress. It turns out that <code>rsync</code> is not available in Recovery, either, although the slower <code>scp</code> is. Unfortunately, despite the network activity, the Mac will fall asleep after about 15 minutes of copying, and <code>scp</code>&mdash;unlike <code>rsync</code>&mdash;cannot resume a copy.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what caused the problem but couldn&rsquo;t find any kernel panic log files. Could that be because the SSD was full? No, Finder showed 37 GB free. I thought I remembered having more like 100 GB free, but 37 GB should be plenty to save a log file. Since Safe Mode and a different user account didn&rsquo;t work, there must be something wrong with the system, despite the Signed System Volume. However, even with the 37 GB, macOS couldn&rsquo;t be installed because the installer said there wasn&rsquo;t enough free space. That sounded suspicious, but I offloaded another 20 GB or so of files and tried again. It still claimed not to have enough free space. It still wouldn&rsquo;t boot.</p>
<p>Well, we already know that with APFS the free space that Finder shows is a lie. Maybe the SSD really is full, and the files that I just deleted are being retained by an APFS snapshot. Unfortunately, <code>tmutil</code> is not available in Recovery. Is there <a href="https://tredje.se/dev/trouble/post/apfs-deleting-timemachine-snapshots-without-tmutil">another way</a> to see and delete snapshots? It turns out that <code>diskutil</code> can also do this. You can&rsquo;t read the man page because <code>man</code> is not available in Recovery. But it does show some usage information if you invoke it without any arguments, or as <code>diskutil apfs</code> to see the APFS commands.</p>
<p>Here are the steps that I used:</p>
<ol>
<li>Even though Disk Utility showed my SSD&rsquo;s Data volume as mounted, it was not actually available to the <code>diskutil</code> snapshot commands in Terminal. I had to mount it using <code>diskutil apfs unlockVolume</code>.</li>
<li>To find the APFS Volume DiskIdentifier, use <code>diskutil apfs list</code>.</li>
<li>To see the snapshots, use <code>diskutil apfs listSnapshots [volume identifier]</code>. This will also show you the disk number.</li>
<li>To delete a snapshot, use <code>diskutil apfs deleteSnapshot [disk number] -uuid [snapshot identifier]</code></li>
</ol>
<p>After deleting a bunch of snapshots, enough <em>real</em> free space was created that I was able to boot the iMac normally. Unfortunately, the problem has repeated twice with macOS 11.3 over the last few weeks. The same fix always works. Most recently, Finder was showing 250 GB of free space, yet apparently the disk was full. I&rsquo;ve now set a reminder to periodically delete old Time Machine snapshots, since macOS is not doing this automatically when it runs out of space, and I can&rsquo;t trust how much space is shown as available.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22432943/apple-epic-trial-steam-link-playstation-games-xbox"><p>Apple says iOS users benefit from a locked-down, curated platform. It rejects &ldquo;stores within stores&rdquo; like the Epic Games Store, which could allegedly expose users to harmful and unvetted software. It&rsquo;s also, however, fighting Epic Games&rsquo; claims that there&rsquo;s no meaningful competition on its platform. So this morning, an Apple attorney grilled one of Epic&rsquo;s witnesses about a slew of iOS-hosted gaming apps. The move might have helped rebut Epic&rsquo;s complaints, but it also highlighted just how arbitrary Apple&rsquo;s policies can seem.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apple is right to call these apps gaming services, but as testimony continued, it wasn&rsquo;t clear they make good App Store alternatives.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apple hammered Epic for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5">offering access to Itch.io</a>, a storefront featuring adult content. But Steam has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17435244/valve-steam-game-release-new-policy">nearly anything-goes policy</a> on porn, and Steam Mobile and Link put those games a few taps away on iOS. Conversely, an App Store executive testified that Roblox user-built &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; were fine because they couldn&rsquo;t sneak new, malicious code onto iPhones. But it&rsquo;s said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations">cloud gaming services threaten</a> the iPhone&rsquo;s &ldquo;safe and trusted&rdquo; model, despite being essentially just streaming video.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macworld.com/article/344971/adobe-drops-postscript-type1.html">
<p>Developed by Adobe way back in the early 1980s, PostScript Type 1 fonts&mdash;a way of encoding vector-based type designs into a particular file format&mdash;will <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/kb/postscript-type-1-fonts-end-of-support.html">lose full support</a> in Adobe Photoshop this year, and gradually disappear from other Adobe products by 2023 as well as from other companies&rsquo; products. If you have a long history in design or using a Mac, you might find yourself unable to use some old type standbys you didn&rsquo;t realize relied on outdated technology.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>And, remarkably, existing PDF and EPS files that contain the older font format won&rsquo;t curdle in storage. Adobe says embedded fonts will continue to display and print correctly in those file types. The only issue that will arise over time is if you wanted to open them to edit the contents after Adobe or other companies have removed Type 1 font interaction.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Adobe offered two methods of creating fonts in the mid-1980s, which were obscurely labeled after their internal specifications: Type 1 and Type 3. Adobe initially reserved Type 1 for itself, and published the Type 3 specification for general use. While Type 3 could do almost anything Type 1 could and a lot more it couldn&rsquo;t, it lacked a feature calling &ldquo;hinting&rdquo; that allowed PostScript to render the vector curves and lines of a font effectively at lower resolutions.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>You can find your Type 1 fonts in two ways in macOS: via the Finder and the Font Book app.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27133929"><p>Speaking as one of the original three authors of Google Docs (Writely), but zero involvement in this project (I left Google in 2010): I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of comments asking how JavaScript-on-Canvas could possibly outperform the highly optimized native code built into the browser engines. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve really been involved in browser coding, but having written both Writely and, farther back, several native-app word processing engines, here are some thoughts.</p><p>Word processors have extremely specific requirements for layout, rendering, and incremental updates. I&rsquo;ll name just two examples. First, to highlight a text selection in mixed left-to-right / right-to-left text, it&rsquo;s necessary to obtain extremely specific information regarding text layout; information that the DOM may not be set up to provide. Second, to smoothly update as the user is typing text, it&rsquo;s often desirable to &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; the reflow process and focus on updating just the line of text containing the insertion point. (Obviously browser engines support text selections, but they probably don&rsquo;t expose the underlying primitives the way a word processor would need. Similarly, they support incremental layout + rendering, but probably not specifically optimized in the precise way a word processor would need.)</p><p>Modern browser engines are amazing feats of engineering, but the feature set they provide, while enormous, is unlikely to exactly match the exacting requirements of a WYSIWYG word processor. As soon as your requirements differ even slightly from the feature set provided, you start tipping over into complex workarounds which impact performance and are hell on developer productivity and application stability / compatibility.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<p>iCloud Drive launched in 2014 as a unified, seamless way for Apple users to keep all their files, documents, and more synchronized across all their devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>iCloud Drive was introduced with iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosemite, which seems like a long time ago. However, if you have hardware that can&rsquo;t update to those versions, this announcement means that syncing will stop working entirely. On Macs, at least, you can use iCloud Drive via the Web.</p>

<p>I tested iCloud in the latest version of Safari for Mavericks, and the page doesn&rsquo;t finish loading; it just shows a spinner. It&rsquo;s possible that Chrome or Firefox would work better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple likes to claim that the App Store replaced the system of selling software in physical boxes in stores and over the mail.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>My experience selling apps before the App Store was not unique or new &mdash; it&rsquo;s only interesting now because people may have forgotten this history, and younger people may never have heard it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We used a service called Kagi for the storefront and credit card processing. Kagi had been around since the &rsquo;90s, and it was well-known and trusted by the Mac community.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>And it was pretty easy. Easier than dealing with the App Store!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find the link, but one of Apple&rsquo;s lawyers recently argued that the reason Apple chose 30% for the App Store fee was that it wanted to do <em>better</em> than the prevailing alternatives at the time. And they again tried to make it sound like they invented selling software online. I&rsquo;ve used at least five different e-commerce providers since <a href="https://c-command.com/blog/2002/01/21/dropdmg-1-0/">2002</a>, and none of them charged more than 15% (most much less). All were easier to deal with than the App Store.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/peternlewis/status/1390858558258876419"><p>Totally the same for me - except I was Kagi&rsquo;s first customer and started with them in 1995, and continue doing the same to this day (other than switching to FastSpring in 2010). It wasn&rsquo;t new over a decade before the App Store was released).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/atomicbird/status/1390783257634119680"><p>I had a very similar experience. I started selling my own apps in 2002, completely online, through a web site and in-app purchase. No boxes, no stores, no mail. Downloads, emailed serial numbers, and a third-party payment service. No Apple online store.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Apple claims they somehow invented online software sales, they are lying. Egregiously.</p></blockquote>

<p>On mobile, my Palm app initially launched in 2001 through proto-app-store PalmGearHQ with a 20% commission, but in 2002 when it started to make serious money I went direct with my own merchant account + abandoned PalmGear entirely by 2005.</p>
<p>But neither for software in general nor for mobile specifically did Apple bring anything new to the table with the App Store; they simply imposed taxes and regulation on an existing market that was getting along perfectly fine without them.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://forums.swift.org/t/lets-fix-if-let-syntax/48188"><p>The if-let syntax discourages long variable names because there&rsquo;s no autocomplete for optional variables that are in scope. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see things like this because programmers are notoriously lazy:</p><pre>if let favc = fooAutomationViewController { &#8230; }</pre><p>Any code within that block that references favc won&rsquo;t be very readable.</p><p>This maintenance issue is exacerbated by name refactoring. Say you want to change fooAutomationViewController to a barAutomatedViewController. The refactored code will then become:</p><pre>if let favc = barAutomatedViewController { &#8230; }</pre></blockquote>
<p>The <code>if let fooAutomationViewController = fooAutomationViewController</code> repetition is one of the more annoying things about writing and reading Swift. Allowing this to be written as just <code>if let fooAutomationViewController</code> seems like the obvious solution. For those arguing that this is confusing or hard to learn, I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s any less clear than what it would be replacing. That said, I wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to something like <a href="https://gist.github.com/erica/aea6a1c55e9e92f843f92e2b16879b0f">unwrap</a>.</p>

<p id="fixing-swifts-if-let-syntax-update-2021-06-18">Update (2021-06-18): <a href="https://blog.metaobject.com/2021/06/if-let-it-be.html">Marcel Weiher</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://blog.metaobject.com/2021/06/if-let-it-be.html"><p>When I added <code>ifNotNil:</code> some time ago, I used the same logic, but it turns out the object
is now actually potentially interesting.  So <code>ifNotNil:</code> now passes the now-known-to-be-non-nil
value to the block and can be used as follows[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the duplication, but does avoid the issue of having the newly introduced variable name precede the original variable.  Well, that and the whole
weird <code>if let</code> in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can do this in Swift by calling <code>map(_:)</code> on the optional. It&rsquo;s useful in some cases, but, since it relies on a closure like <code>forEach(_:)</code>, it&rsquo;s often not a good fit because it doesn&rsquo;t compose well with other language features (additional optionals to be unwrapped, <code>continue</code>, <code>return</code>, etc.).</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Officially, nothing is changing for those of us just using Sketch as a traditional Mac app. But, as with <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/04/06/textexpander-6-and-textexpander-com/">TextExpander</a> and <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2017/07/14/1password-standalone-vaults-and-passwordwallet/">1Password</a>, it&rsquo;s not a good feeling when the developer declares a use case that you&rsquo;re not interested in to be the future of the app. Note that I&rsquo;m not saying that these were bad business decisions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like Transmit iOS and Status Board before it, we&rsquo;re discontinuing Code Editor as it doesn&rsquo;t generate enough revenue to cover its continued development.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The churn of new web tools and tech is rapid and constant. This is why having a flexible extension system is essential for a modern web-focused IDE. But that&rsquo;s where the trouble lies.</p>
<p>The biggest technical hurdle is the inability to run external processes on iOS and iPadOS. There&rsquo;s just no way around it: this is required for modern web development.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Even if it were viable, we&rsquo;d likely run afoul of App Store policy as well. Apps on iOS and iPadOS must use Apple&rsquo;s Javascript interpreter, JavaScriptCore. Although JavaScriptCore is excellent, many developer tools rely on features or behaviors only present in Google&rsquo;s V8 JavaScript interpreter. Similarly, WebKit is the only allowed web rendering engine on iOS.</p>
<p>And still, even if we could find some clever technical way around all of these limitations, we wouldn&rsquo;t know if our approaches would be allowed on the App Store until we&rsquo;d fully built and submitted them for review. So, we&rsquo;d be facing a huge investment of time with the possibility that it would all ultimately get rejected.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/rip-diet-coda/"><p>Panic has tried to crack this nut multiple times without success, but it is hard to see how any developer can make iOS work for apps like these. We all know that Panic makes great software, it has enthusiastic users, and it has long been a high-profile independent developer. Even if iOS is out of the question, evidence is mounting that Apple is kneecapping iPadOS by continuing to treat it with the same kinds of developer and app distribution rules as a smartphone.</p></blockquote>

<p>I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but this is yet another example of why Apple needs to open up the platform. Not just so developers can explore other options for monetization, but to loosen up the arbitrary restrictions on what is even possible on the platform. How many apps like Code Editor do we have to lose before Apple wakes up?</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"><p>And while Epic itself has focused on explaining <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari">why web apps aren&rsquo;t a good substitute for native ones</a>, its expert witness David Evans brought up another major issue: anti-steering rules.</p><p>Anti-steering rules (in this context) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_2093">refer to rules that ban</a> developers from pointing users outside of Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem. iOS developers can&rsquo;t add links or references telling people to get a better deal on their website, or send emails to accounts created through Apple.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Evans basically responded that in this analogy, cab drivers can&rsquo;t even do the equivalent of giving passengers their phone numbers. [&#8230;] The problem, he said, was the combination of requiring Epic to use Apple payment processing, plus a &ldquo;whole set of barriers&rdquo; that make it harder to tell users they have an alternative.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Evans admitted that nixing the anti-steering provisions &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t eliminate the market power that Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Later in the day, economist Susan Athey raised a different issue with App Store exclusivity. The App Store lets users sign up for subscriptions, but if they switch to an Android phone, they have to either cancel their subscription or keep managing it through Apple. Athey was using this to explain why a third-party app store would be useful, should Apple ever allow one to exist &mdash; if you could access the same purchase from both big phone platforms, the same way you can get your old iOS apps on a new iPhone, switching devices could become much easier.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/"><p>Threats have been present since the first day the App Store launched on iPhone, and they&rsquo;ve increased in both scale and sophistication in the years since. Apple has likewise scaled its efforts to meet those threats, taking relentless steps forward to combat these risks to users and developers alike.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In 2020 alone, Apple&rsquo;s combination of sophisticated technology and human expertise protected customers from more than $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions, preventing the attempted theft of their money, information, and time &mdash; and kept nearly a million risky and vulnerable new apps out of their hands.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>If a developer violation is egregious or repeated, the offender is expelled from the Apple Developer Program and their account terminated. Apple terminated 470,000 developer accounts in 2020 and rejected an additional 205,000 developer enrollments over fraud concerns, preventing these bad actors from ever submitting an app to the store.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/11/apple-on-app-store-fraud">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/11/apple-on-app-store-fraud"><p>What Apple is trying to say is that this is a five nines sort of problem&#x2009;&mdash;&#x2009;that they could (and do) stop 99.999 percent of scams but the App Store is such a juicy target for crooks that hundreds of scams still slip though.</p>
<p>Why not 99.99999 percent efficiency though? Apple is the richest company in the world. If they want to run the App Store with whatever-they-say-goes authority, why should we, as customers, demand anything less than perfection on the fraud and scam front? True perfection they&rsquo;re never going to achieve, but it sure seems like Apple could be doing better than they are. And they know it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/app-store-fraud-statement/">Nick Heer</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/app-store-fraud-statement/"><p>The half-a-million developer accounts terminated in 2020 compares to only about 180,000 new developers Apple says that it worked with to get their apps into the App Store.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the numbers in this press release have any attached context. For example, Apple says that it rejected over 215,000 apps in 2020 for not meeting its privacy standards. But to understand what that means in terms of the total number of submissions, you have to go find the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/app-store-35-percent-of-apps-rejected/">documents that surfaced</a> in the company&rsquo;s lawsuit with Epic Games, where you will find an average of about five million apps submitted annually, around 35% of which are rejected for any reason. But we still don&rsquo;t know anything about the kinds of apps that were rejected. How many of the 215,000 apps were ever admitted into the store? And were any of them downloaded by users before being pulled? The answers to these kinds of questions are not in this press release.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>These are the only options available to report a fraudulent app? <em>These</em>? I have already covered how <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/app-store-scams-reporting/">Report a Problem is insufficient</a> for raising alarms about a rule-breaking app, particularly if it is free. And the only other thing I can do, as a customer, is to telephone Apple Support? <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/nyt-dark-patterns/">Ridiculous</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>David Evans explained in court on Monday and Tuesday that although Apple has competition when it comes to actually making smartphones, it monopolizes what he described as a market for distributing apps. That control, Evans argued, leads to inappropriately high prices for consumers and competitors as well as an array of other ills.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store">
<p>One of the most curious questions arising from the ongoing Epic Games v. Apple antitrust trial, now on its seventh day of testimony, is why both sides are so intent on establishing their own definitions of basic tech and game industry terms.</p>
<p>Does a phone qualify as a game console, or is it a computer, or both? What&rsquo;s a special-purpose device, and what&rsquo;s a general one? But perhaps the most perplexing line of inquiry has been what is and what is not a video game. Is Roblox a game, or just a platform, or maybe it&rsquo;s an app store? How about Minecraft? What any of this means for the future of Fortnite is still a bit fuzzy, but it&rsquo;s starting to come into focus with each passing day in court.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s stat: &ldquo;470,000 developer accounts terminated&rdquo; in 2020 doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. The vast majority of those could have been terminated because the developer moved on and didn&rsquo;t pay their annual fee.</p>

<p>Peely&rsquo;s <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238">nightmarish existence</a> is barely related to Apple&rsquo;s case. And the &ldquo;naked banana&rdquo; comment would probably have passed for a throwaway joke, but for one very important fact: Apple slammed Epic last week by claiming that it hosted porn.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s tutorial was clearly aimed at showing that Fortnite is mostly a game and not an &ldquo;experience&rdquo; or &ldquo;metaverse&rdquo; &mdash; encouraging the judge to weigh the App Store&rsquo;s game-related policies against similar rules on consoles, rather than scrutinizing the whole iOS ecosystem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, such content is already available on iPhone via Safari, and via third-party apps such as Web browsers, site-specific browsers, and e-book readers.

Allison demurred, although he later pushed back on Apple&rsquo;s veiled suggestion that Epic kick Itch.io off the Epic Games Store. &ldquo;Itch.io is an incredible community for developers that we support fully,&rdquo; Allison said, &ldquo;they have an open platform, and therefore have different moderation standards than the Epic Games Store.&rdquo;</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Some people were upset at Apple going after a platform that&rsquo;s particularly favored by queer developers offering depictions of sexuality you won&rsquo;t find in big-budget games.</p></blockquote>

<p>Allison replied by pointing out that itch.io is on Epic, but it is not, itself, the Epic Games Store. &ldquo;Itch.io is an app store that is not the Epic Games Store. We are not included in itch&rsquo;s distributing pitch,&rdquo; Allison said. &ldquo;Epic is only distributing the app store of itch.io.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems like they create a trust score of your app based on a list of binary &amp; metadata criteria, and then review what&rsquo;s changed between versions</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390770719324258312">Apple acquired SourceDNA</a> in 2016 to improve the automated binary analysis portion of App Review</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390773022764814340">As of 2015, there were 910</a> (!) different rules and other criteria that App Review used to approve/deny apps. Only a fraction of those are actually communicated to developers in the App Review Guidelines</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390773394845675521">Here are the top ten&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390776644730859523">App Review&rsquo;s static analysis</a> includes checking for cookie-cutter apps, and the strings in your binary. Dynamic analysis runs your binary on a test farm and sees what you&rsquo;re actually doing at runtime</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390785802951663617">Roblox was rejected</a> for having minigames, and appealed to the App Review Board, saying that they would only add/remove minigames with submissions and not remotely. Nobody on the board replied to the email, so Roblox was given the go-ahead</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390787562864787461">Apple can end your business</a> and not bother to reply to your email asking why or how you can change. Tribe was thrown under the bus (UTB) by another app developer presumably wondering why they had been rejected, and as a result got thrown out after 3 years on the App Store</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390794725100343308">Apple thinks developers</a> are liars or idiots for telling Bloomberg that they &mdash; correctly &mdash; were approved to be on the App Store. There was no rule at the time to justify removing them, so Apple did it anyway and invented one after the fact</p>
<p>Apple didn&rsquo;t want to come out publicly and say so, because it knew it had no actual rule to point to</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390797460189089797">Turns out it&rsquo;s developers</a>, via the developer agreement, that are responsible for ensuring the quality of apps on the App Store, not App Review at all. This is not surprising, but it could be an important distinction</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&lsquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390800348378447873">The reason we lost Safari</a> on Windows is the same reason we&rsquo;re losing Safari on Mac. We didn&rsquo;t innovate or enhance Safari&rsquo;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1390801965966311424">Apple was utterly convinced</a> of its iPhone (P2) security in 2006 right before it was announced. iPhone made it a month and a half after release before being jailbroken to run third-party apps, bypassing every security measure there was.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4">Adi Robertson</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390323366494617610">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"><p>Epic spent the fourth day of trial offering its counter-narrative: the iOS App Store isn&rsquo;t actually very good. Calling two Apple executives to the stand, Epic&rsquo;s attorneys took jabs at everything from the update review process to Apple allegedly leaking Marshmello&rsquo;s Fortnite concert playlist. They pushed Apple to justify its claims about privacy and security by producing hard research demonstrating threats and breaches &mdash; which Apple largely didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The attorneys spent much of their time trying to catch Apple executives in contradictions, and while they quoted disgruntled developers like the ones above, they rarely delved into the substance of their complaints. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers became audibly irritated with Epic repeatedly producing documents to establish a &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; about the App Store rather than hard facts, since the files would be uploaded for public viewing.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one plausible reason Epic doesn&rsquo;t have more specific stories: many developers are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html">reportedly scared to criticize Apple</a>. That&rsquo;s been a running theme in congressional scrutiny of Apple, and Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store[&#8230;]</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/app-store-chief-walled-garden">Nick Statt</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1390310988415750145">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/app-store-chief-walled-garden">
<p>Matt Fischer, the current App Store vice president who reports directly to longtime executive Phil Schiller, took the stand in Oakland as an Epic witness to answer questions about the App Store business model, as well as its role in the broader iOS operating system.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Fischer provided the company&rsquo;s first robust rationalization for many of the App Store&rsquo;s more controversial policies. He called the store "incredibly unique" in the benefits it provides to consumers and developers and steadfastly defended it against claims that Apple overlooks fraud. That, in turn, justifies the commission Apple collects and the restrictions it imposes.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The key takeaway from day four is that the future of this trial could very well hinge on how Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers perceives the true purpose of the App Store. Is it a level playing field designed to protect user privacy and security and take only its fair share? Or is it an increasingly byzantine pillar of Apple&rsquo;s walled garden, one preoccupied with chasing profit and marred by inconsistently applied and ever-changing rules?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The App Store chief also shed light on how Apple came to the conclusion it would not charge certain app makers a 30% fee if they produced a physical good or service, compared to a digital one like Epic and other game developers.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1390388575406108672">
<p>[Fischer] argues Apple didn&rsquo;t want to take 30% of, say, an Uber ride or Amazon purchase because Apple couldn&rsquo;t guarantee / had no insight into whether the product or service was delivered as ordered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/Evalic1ous/status/1390394795898593281">don&rsquo;t see</a> how it really does for digital content, either.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390419296669601795">
<p>Epic is now calling Trystan Kosmynka, senior director of marketing at Apple.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recall an app called Tribe?"</p>
<p>Describing app being &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; for being a store within a store, but it&rsquo;s been live since 2015. So it was on the store for about 3 years before the ERB ruling.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Raising the example of Roblox, which Epic lawyer refers to as a game with a collection of games in it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it that way,&rdquo; says Kosmynka.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Just to be clear, the argument here is that experiences <em>inside</em> Roblox (which IIRC there are actual game studios devoted to building) are not games, because otherwise Roblox could be arguably similar to the Epic Games Store in being a store inside the App Store.</p>

Apple&rsquo;s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.</p>

<p>I find Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1360599846256844800">definition of tracking</a> very confusing. Apple News and <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/02/22/google-vs-ios-app-privacy-labels/">Google&rsquo;s apps</a> both use an opaque advertising identifier, separate from your user or device ID, and I guess this is somehow why they are able to say that they don&rsquo;t track you. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem like that should be enough. As Lockdown shows, Apple seems to be sharing the data with a third-party data broker. And, unless Google is segregating its data, it is falling afoul of the clause about linking app data with data collected from third-party apps or Web sites.</p>

<p>For Facebook, even if it uses the IDFA, Apple <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/08/26/facebook-sdk-will-not-adopt-apples-ios-14-privacy-prompt/">considers that tracking</a>. Facebook knows who you are in the Facebook app because you&rsquo;re logged in. But if an ad leads you to purchase an app, you probably won&rsquo;t log into Facebook from within that app. So how can they know it&rsquo;s you? Well, if that app can report the same IDFA to Facebook, that proves that you purchased the app.</p>

<p>Apple gets around this without &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; because it controls the App Store app, which is the only way to purchase apps. The ad and the purchase both happen in the same app, and they&rsquo;ve defined tracking such that that doesn&rsquo;t count. It&rsquo;s not tracking if you <a href="https://twitter.com/mjtsai/status/1361400676631347205">own everything</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been niggling at me for months that App Tracking Transparency is defined in such a way that Apple&rsquo;s own data collection activity is unaffected.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d refer to this as Apple&rsquo;s ad tracking. Apple officially calls this &ldquo;Personalised Ads&rdquo;, because it wants to define tracking as a third-party concept. The behaviour of Personalised Ads is not conveyed through any kind of user-facing dialog or permissions prompt, unlike Apple Tracking Transparency. In fact, Apple enables ads personalisation by default. The setting to turn it off is buried in Settings, tucked away at the bottom of the Privacy screen (conveniently positioned <a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1358868694764580867">below the fold</a>).</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I think what irks me the most about this situation is that an Apple ID is a prerequisite to owning an iPhone and you can&rsquo;t download any application from the App Store without one. Apple&rsquo;s delineations of first-party and third-party allows the App Store to share any information it pleases with the News app, without telling the user at all. It feels wrong that News silently target ads to me based on the apps I download, the music I listen to and the television shows I watch.</p>

<p>A few months back I was surprised to see that Zoom had somehow been able to tap into using the camera during iPad Split View multitasking. This is an obvious feature for a videoconferencing app so that you can keep one eye on your meeting while you consult notes, look at a presentation, or slack off on Twitter.</p>
<p>I scoured the web and found no reference to how to enable this feature for our own iOS Zoom client, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1532789823">Participant for Zoom</a>. We asked Zoom and to our surprise they gave us the answer, and in the process revealed an apparently private process, available only to those deemed worthy by Apple.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unlike with CarPlay there is no public process for requesting this entitlement. In fact, its existence is not even documented by Apple publicly.</p>

<p>Link directly to relevant WWDC videos from API pages, ideally to precise timestamps. Even better, make sure everything mentioned in those videos gets included in the text documentation too.</p>

Apple has simply been testing these APIs among a small group of developers for perhaps the last eleven years as it readies a wider rollout; there is no other way to interpret this situation.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3">
<p>Is an iPhone more like a PC or an Xbox?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Epic called up Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox business development head Lori Wright as a sympathetic witness. In response to a line of questioning, Wright divided computing devices into &ldquo;special-purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;general-purpose&rdquo; devices &mdash; in a way that clearly defined iPhones as the latter.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to call the iPhone anything but a general-purpose device under Wright&rsquo;s definition. (She described a &ldquo;special-purpose&rdquo; Apple product as something like an iPod.) Intentionally or not, Wright also linked the distinction to one of Epic&rsquo;s major talking points: profit.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/microsoft-confirms-the-xbox-hardware-business-loses-money">Nick Statt</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/microsoft-confirms-the-xbox-hardware-business-loses-money"><p>&ldquo;We sell the consoles at a loss,&rdquo; Wright said. Asked why Microsoft would continue to do this, Wright elaborated that Xbox business model involves selling hardware at a loss and subsidizing it with game sales and subscription services, in this case to services such as Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass. The goal is to serve an &ldquo;end-to-end consumer experience.&rdquo; When asked if Microsoft has ever earned a profit on the sale of an Xbox device, Wright said no.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1389987892613812226">Adi Robertson</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1389987892613812226"><p>Wright says Spotify has many songs and Netflix has many films. &ldquo;Why could we not have a single app with many games?&rdquo; Microsoft spent 3-4 months trying to &ldquo;understand what this was.&rdquo;</p><p>Microsoft decided the logistics didn&rsquo;t work &mdash; if you wanted to push an update, for instance, every single game in the catalog would have to update. &ldquo;All your apps would just be constantly spinning.&rdquo;</p><p>If Microsoft took a game from the catalog, the way Netflix does,  &ldquo;there&rsquo;d be a dead app on the phone. We thought this was a really inelegant way for players to experience this.&rdquo;</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Apple&rsquo;s lawyer is not necessarily in the wrong here but is coming off as being pretty snide &mdash; asking next if Wright is aware the App Store had guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Apple didn&rsquo;t change the guidelines to ban xCloud until after Microsoft had submitted it.</p>

<p>The price has grown so high, it has nearly hit the maximum number that can be stored in one common way exchange computers handle digits.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Nasdaq Inc. temporarily suspended broadcasting prices for Class A shares of Berkshire over several popular data feeds. Such feeds provide real-time price updates for a number of online brokerages and finance websites.</p>
<p>Nasdaq&rsquo;s computers can only count so high because of the compact digital format they use for communicating prices. The biggest number they can handle is $429,496.7295. Nasdaq is rushing to finish an upgrade later this month that would fix the problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, right now my only answer is to say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s displaying properly in every other podcast app around, so if you&rsquo;ve ever thought of using Overcast or Castro or Pocket Casts or any other alternative podcast app, now might be a good time to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an issue on Apple&rsquo;s side. Apple is aware of it and presumably is working on a fix.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the new Apple Podcasts now centralizes (&amp; delays) refreshes of feeds, which is kinda frustrating if you want to listen to things the moment they are released. No amount of manual refreshing will convince Apple to reload the feed on the server</p>

<blockquote cite="https://tidbits.com/2021/05/04/prevent-apples-updated-podcasts-app-from-eating-your-storage/">
<p>Apple recently overhauled the Podcasts app for the gazillionth time in iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and macOS 11.3 Big Sur, but unfortunately, it appears that Podcasts is still a hot mess.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I immediately noticed that I was already suffering from one of the complaints: Podcasts resetting your download settings and downloading every episode of every podcast you subscribe to or that has even a single episode in your library.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had Apple&rsquo;s Podcasts app available on various platforms for nearly nine years now, but it has never been very good. After that amount of time, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that Apple will ever make it more than a lowest-common-denominator app for those who don&rsquo;t know to find a better alternative in the App Store.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, users may not have much choice if Apple Podcasts Susbcriptions means that exclusive content ends up there.</p>

We&rsquo;re working to move Visual Studio for Mac to native macOS UI, which means it will come with better performance and reliability. It also means that Visual Studio for Mac can take full advantage of all the built-in macOS accessibility features. We&rsquo;re updating the menus and terminology across the IDE to make Visual Studio more consistent between Mac and Windows. The new Git experience from Visual Studio will also be coming to Visual Studio for Mac, beginning with the introduction of the Git Changes tool window.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/05/netflix-apple-in-app-purchase/"><p>As part of the Epic vs. Apple trial, a detailed new email thread has come to light showcasing internal communication at Apple once the company became aware of Netflix&rsquo;s plans to roll out an A/B test focused on use of the App Store&rsquo;s In-App Purchase system.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The &ldquo;voluntary churn issue&rdquo; that Oliver refers to is that Netflix has a higher amount of &ldquo;voluntary churn&rdquo; among those paying via the App Store.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is interesting since I&rsquo;m always reading that App Store subscriptions are <em>more</em> sticky because the payment information is more likely to be up-to-date.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/05/netflix-apple-in-app-purchase/">
<p>Also in the email, Oliver questioned whether Apple should take any &ldquo;punitive measures&rdquo; in response to Netflix&rsquo;s planned test to remove IAP support in certain markets. &ldquo;Do we want to take any punitive measures in response to the test (for examples, pulling all global featuring during the test period)?&rdquo; Oliver wrote. &ldquo;If so, how should those punitive measures be communicated to Netflix?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I think anyone could look at this and fairly wonder why an operating system vendor is mucking around so deeply inside the business of a popular app</p>
<p>Apple here is wondering what else it can do to justify taking a 30 percent cut of Netflix signups on iOS. The only reasons it&rsquo;s doing that are 1. it knows it&rsquo;s not doing enough to keep Netflix from removing IAP and 2. it has the threat of Netflix app signups going down to rely on</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now found on most smartphones in some form,  Night Shift  is based on studies that have demonstrated that blue light can negatively impact sleep by altering the body&rsquo;s circadian rhythm. However, the results of a new study from BYU published in <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352721821000607?dgcid=coauthor">Sleep Health</a></em> have undermined that premise.</p>
<p>To test the theory, BYU psychology professor Chad Jensen and researchers from the Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital Medical Center compared the sleep outcomes of individuals in three categories: those who used their phone at night with the  Night Shift  function turned on, those who used their phone at night without  Night Shift, and those who did not use a smartphone before bed at all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sleep benefits or not, I do find it more comfortable. Perhaps BYU&rsquo;s results differ from previous studies because Night Shift shifts the colors much less than f.lux or blue light glasses.</p>

<p id="night-shift-sleep-study-update-2021-05-06">Update (2021-05-06): <a href="https://twitter.com/JustGetFlux/status/1389970401480962050">f.lux</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/JustGetFlux/status/1389970401480962050"><p>The first thing to show is any difference between using a phone and not using one - this study doesn&rsquo;t show any difference, with P&gt;0.5. So that&rsquo;s the headline really.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t know if this is just underpowered, or if dimming + night modes are &ldquo;enough&rdquo; for most people.</p><p>Even so, Night Shift is not doing very much - f.lux is about 7x stronger by default.</p><p>To sum up: If you can&rsquo;t even show you have a problem, you cannot fix it, and making a very minor change probably won&rsquo;t fix it anyway.</p></blockquote>

<p>I like Night Shift because I run my devices in Light Mode. But I bet it offers much less blue light benefit for those running in Dark Mode all the time, or in Automatic mode where the phone automatically switches to Dark Mode at night. With so much less white content in Dark Mode, the effect of Night Shift is much more subtle. If most users are using Dark Mode at night, anyway, that could also explain why the study found no significant difference vs. not using a phone at all.</p>

Comfort is comfort&#x2009;&mdash;&#x2009;if you Night Shift feels easier on your eyes, go ahead and use it. What I object to is the &ldquo;may help you get a better night&rsquo;s sleep&rdquo; claim. Apple should keep the feature but change the language describing it to remove any suggestion that it&rsquo;s a sleep aid, unless subsequent studies suggest otherwise.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"><p>Apple <em>did </em>support cross-wallet play before banning <em>Fortnite</em> last year &mdash; and on the trial&rsquo;s second day, that fact became a serious pitfall for Epic. Apple continued a long cross-examination of Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, whose hours of testimony included a digression on whether <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1">counts as a true metaverse</a> or simply a big free-to-play game that has concerts. (Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers suggested, and Sweeney concurred, that &ldquo;the most readily acceptable analogy&rdquo; might be Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s <em>Ready Player One</em>.)</p>
<p>Sweeney was followed by two witnesses from outside Epic: the founder of an iOS yoga app, followed by the product manager for Nvidia&rsquo;s cloud gaming service. All argued that Apple&rsquo;s tightly managed App Store forced customers to use clunky workarounds. Meanwhile, Apple argued that the workarounds weren&rsquo;t necessarily worse &mdash; just different.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/epic-apple-tim-sweeney-testimony">Nick Statt</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1389591421473239048">tweet</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/epic-apple-tim-sweeney-testimony"><p>The theme emerging from both days of testimony is that Sweeney sees this as a fight that goes well beyond a single game and even a single platform. In Epic&rsquo;s eyes, suing Apple is an existential fight for the future for media, computing and software distribution, and maintaining the status quo would represent a major setback for Epic&rsquo;s ambitions.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Doren raised a number of questions about Sony&rsquo;s negotiations with Epic. The most important of those was how <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22419087/epic-v-apple-trial-sony-playstation-fortnite-cross-play-fee">Epic paid Sony additional revenue</a> over the standard 70-30 revenue split on PlayStation to compensate for cross-play, a feature Epic received significant pushback over and which it had to carefully orchestrate across all major console platforms.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>[Sweeney] also repeated his argument that game consoles, which are largely single-purpose devices and not general computing ones, are often sold at a loss and make up the difference through software sales. In Sweeney&rsquo;s eyes, that justifies a higher commission. [&#8230;] The point of the exercise, including a hypothetical from Epic&rsquo;s lawyer over checking a bank balance at the doctor&rsquo;s office using a game console, was that phones are multi-purpose, general computing devices and that game consoles are not valid substitutes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.macworld.com/article/345475/the-pressure-is-on-apple-to-address-accusations-of-anticompetitive-behavior.html"><p>The big question is, will Apple be able to bargain with the powers that be, offering smaller changes that will take pressure and scrutiny off of the rest of the company&rsquo;s practices? Or will it be forced to change in ways it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t want by judges and regulators who have decided that its behavior is in violation of the law?</p>
<p>This is complicated stuff. There&rsquo;s no way to tell how it&rsquo;ll turn out. But it&rsquo;s worth considering some of the possibilities, which I&rsquo;ll rank from most likely to happen (and generally, least catastrophic to Apple) to least likely (and most catastrophic).</p></blockquote>

<p>Script Debugger&rsquo;s appearance has been updated to fit nicely into macOS Big Sur. Script Debugger 8 runs natively on Apple&rsquo;s new M1 Macs, and generates universal Intel/ARM applications when running under macOS Big Sur, regardless of platform.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>To go along with Dark Mode support, Script Debugger 8 provides user configurable and switchable themes.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Viewing script library documentation has been made much easier with the introduction of a Libraries section within Script Debugger&rsquo;s dictionary window.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Script Debugger 8 offers vastly expanded options for generating standalone applications, along with the ability to code-sign and notarize applications.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Security changes introduced in macOS Mojave and later rendered Script Debugger&rsquo;s external debugging feature inoperable. For Script Debugger 8 we&rsquo;ve removed external debugging[&#8230;]</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something weird going on with AppleScript on Apple Silicon Macs. <a href="https://forum.c-command.com/t/spamsieve-not-working-on-m1-macbook-air/13371">I</a> <a href="https://freron.lighthouseapp.com/projects/58672-mailmate/tickets/2786-mailmate-handing-empty-messages-to-spamsieve">and</a> <a href="https://discourse.hookproductivity.com/t/fixed-with-3-0-compiled-universal-m1-intel-preview-app-not-working-for-some-m1-big-sur-customers/2889">others</a> have encountered problems where AppleScript commands time out and fail when either the sending or receiving app is running in Rosetta. So it&rsquo;s great news that my preferred AppleScript editor now runs natively.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s $100 or $50 to upgrade, with many of the features working in the free <a href="https://latenightsw.com/sd8/feature-comparison/">lite mode</a>.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.protocol.com/apple-epic-trial/epic-games-apple-lawsuit"><p>On Monday, Apple and Epic Games will meet in court to decide one of the most consequential antitrust arguments in the history of the tech industry. The trial has been nearly a year in the making, following Apple&rsquo;s removal of Fortnite from the App Store in August 2020. It&rsquo;s arguably the biggest courtroom showdown Apple has engaged in since its smartphone patent war with Samsung nearly a decade ago.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Epic v. Apple starts Monday and is estimated to last about three weeks. In total, each side will have 45 hours to present its case. Gonzalez Rogers has been overseeing the case since the beginning and will preside over the trial as well.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Each witness will wait in a sort of green room before they&rsquo;re called to the stand. Beyond that, each company also gets a &ldquo;designated representative&rdquo; who can be in the courtroom the entire time.

<blockquote cite="https://www.macstories.net/stories/epic-versus-apple-the-macstories-overview/"><p>There&rsquo;s more to these disputes than Epic&rsquo;s allegation that Apple violated antitrust laws and Apple&rsquo;s claims that Epic violated its developer agreement. Underlying it all is the way the dispute was precipitated by Epic. The Fortnite creator&rsquo;s actions don&rsquo;t necessarily absolve Apple of antitrust violations, but Epic&rsquo;s calculated orchestration of events leading to the dispute <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493096/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store-court-hearing">have not gone unnoticed by the judge</a> presiding over the case and may influence the trial&rsquo;s outcome. Coupled with Epic&rsquo;s efforts to get <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-files-antitrust-complaint-against-apple-in-the-eu.html">regulators</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-epic-games/epic-games-files-complaint-against-apple-with-uk-regulator-idUSKBN2BM19O">around</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/23/two-goliaths-apple-labels-epics-australian-challenge-to-in-app-purchases-self-serving">the world</a> to take up its cause and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">its very public crusade</a> against the way Apple operates the App Store, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the claims haven&rsquo;t settled.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>The App Store itself may be on trial in the court of public opinion, but the issues in dispute before the judge are far narrower. I suspect that will leave many of Apple&rsquo;s critics dissatisfied regardless of the result, especially since with inevitable appeals, the next few weeks is just the opening round in what promises to be a much longer dispute.</p><p>However, while the outcome of Epic&rsquo;s lawsuit may not satisfy App Store critics, the intense scrutiny will likely be a force for positive change regardless, as we&rsquo;ve already seen with changes such as <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-updates-multiple-app-review-guidelines-addressing-game-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-advertising-and-more/">modifications to the App Review Guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-reduces-app-store-commissions-to-15-for-small-businesses-starting-next-year/">Small Business Program</a>. Apple would undoubtedly deny those changes were made in response to the pressure of litigation, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that the lawsuits and interest of regulators around the world haven&rsquo;t at least influenced some of the positive changes to the App Store, which is a step in the right direction to making it a better option for all developers.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, regulatory intervention might look at side-loading and third party stores, but the focus has to be on Apple&rsquo;s default store and Apple&rsquo;s rules.

<p>Mostly I just hope after this trial that Epic and Apple can get back to making sure stuff like Unreal works well on the Mac and iOS. It&rsquo;s been real unsettling how Unreal has not been part of the Apple Silicon campaign, given their market dominance.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apple tried to push a narrative today that Metal was something Apple did for Epic, and that Epic should be thankful for. But it doesn&rsquo;t mention how much legitimacy Epic has given to Metal. Especially on low volume platforms like the Mac.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is only possible because Apple made it possible in macOS 11.4. I&rsquo;m certain it required changes to the M1&rsquo;s startup process and to asr to finally make it happen. Without those changes, we couldn&rsquo;t have done this in a supported way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>My thanks to Oak Snow Consulting for sponsoring the blog this week.</em></p>

<p>Do you want to teach your kids to program? Help them take their first steps with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seaturtle-coding-for-kids/id1446387907?mt=12">SeaTurtle</a>, a turtle graphics&ndash;oriented programming language built for macOS. SeaTurtle is an extremely simple programming environment inspired by Logo and BASIC. It has very few features&mdash;just enough to engage learners in the pursuit of turtle graphics.</p>

<div style="display: table; margin: 0 auto;"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seaturtle-coding-for-kids/id1446387907?mt=12"><img src="https://mjtsai.com/images/2021-05-02-seaturtle/SeaTurtleScreenShot@2x.png" alt="SeaTurtle" height="306" width="506" border="0" /></a></div>

<p>Did you learn to program in Logo? Why not give your children the same gentle introduction in a more modern environment designed specifically for the Mac. SeaTurtle comes with ample example programs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrHsvNS8zF4&amp;feature=youtu.be">video tutorials</a>, and a detailed <a href="https://www.oaksnow.com/seaturtle/help/overview.html">language guide</a>.</p>

<p>Help Sally write her first loop, subroutine, and if-statement. Help her do it in a language with no special characters, no case sensitivity, and keywords so self-explanatory it&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s play. Then she can export her work to an animated GIF to share with her friends. She&rsquo;ll be ready in no-time to graduate to a real language like JavaScript or Python. SeaTurtle is training wheels for programming.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seaturtle-coding-for-kids/id1446387907?mt=12">Purchase SeaTurtle today for $4.99 on the Mac App Store</a>. We&rsquo;re proud to do our first advertising by sponsoring Michael&rsquo;s blog, a great resource for developers who remember growing up with Logo and BASIC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote cite="https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds-linux-and-git"><p>Thirty years ago, Linus Torvalds was a 21 year old student at the University of Helsinki when he first released the Linux Kernel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux#The_creation_of_Linux">His announcement started</a>, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won&rsquo;t be big and professional&#8230;)&rdquo;. Three decades later, <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">the top 500 supercomputers are all running Linux</a>, as are over 70% of all smartphones. Linux is clearly both big and professional.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds-linux-and-git"><p>I&rsquo;m 100% convinced that the license has been a big part of the success of Linux (and Git, for that matter). I think everybody involved ends up being much happier when they know that everybody has equal rights, and nobody is special with regards to licensing. [&#8230;] The right to fork and do your own thing is important, but the other side of the coin is <em>equally</em> important - the right to then always join back together when a fork was shown to be successful.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>I use this abomination called &ldquo;micro-emacs&rdquo;, which has absolutely nothing to do with GNU emacs except that some of the key bindings are similar. I got used to it at the University of Helsinki when I was a wee lad, and I&rsquo;ve not been able to wean myself from it, although I suspect I will have to soon enough.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>But that &ldquo;mailing list as an archive&rdquo; model works very well, and works seamlessly together with the whole &ldquo;send patches between developers as emails&rdquo; and &ldquo;send problem reports as emails&rdquo;.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>If anything, what is interesting about the last decade is how we&rsquo;ve actually kept the actual development model really smooth, and what hasn&rsquo;t changed. [&#8230;] So for the last decade, we&rsquo;ve made absolutely huge changes (Git makes it easy to show some statistics in numbers: about three quarters of a million commits by over 17 thousand people).</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>So one of the main things the VFS layer does is really handle all the locking and caching of pathname components, and handle all the serialization and the mount point traversal, and do it all with mostly lock-free algorithms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update">RCU</a>), but also with some really clever lock-like things (the Linux kernel &ldquo;lockref&rdquo; lock is a very special &ldquo;spinlock with reference count&rdquo; which was literally designed <em>for</em> the dcache caching, and it&rsquo;s basically a specialized lock-aware reference count that can do lock elision for certain common situations). [&#8230;] The Linux dcache is simply in a class all its own.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds-open-source-and-beyond-part-2"><p>The other big thing is that you have to be open. And I mean that in multiple ways. It&rsquo;s really easy to create some kind of &ldquo;clique&rdquo; of people, where you have an inner cabal that discusses things in private, and then you see really only the end result (or the fringe work) in the open, because all the important stuff happened inside a company or within a core group of people, and outsiders have a hard time breaking into that clique, and often have a hard time even seeing what is going on in that core group because it was so private and exclusive.</p><p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I really like open mailing lists. Not some &ldquo;by invitation&rdquo; list. Not something you even have to sign up to participate in. Really open. And pretty much all the development discussions should be there.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>But is it sustainable? Yes. I&rsquo;m personally 100% convinced that not only is open source sustainable, but for complex technical issues you really need open source simply because the problem space ends up being too complex to manage inside one single company. Even a big and competent tech company.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;30-year plan&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t even have a 5-year plan. In fact, I don&rsquo;t plan ahead more than a release or two (which is obviously just a few months).</p><p>As an engineer, I have this strongly held opinion that &ldquo;details matter&rdquo;. Details are almost the <em>only</em> thing that matters. If you get the details right, the rest will follow.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That said, Apple is on perhaps the firmest footing it has ever been on. The iPhone, iPad, and Mac are more popular than ever. The risky switch from Intel processors to Apple&rsquo;s own M1 chip in the Mac has been nothing short of a smashing success, both critically and commercially. And Apple&rsquo;s Services business seems to have unlimited room for growth. So, while Apple may not exceed these results next quarter&mdash;Cook noted that Apple would be &ldquo;supply-gated, not demand-gated&rdquo; in the coming quarter, having burned through much of its material reserves to counter supply constraints in Q2&mdash;the demand for Apple goods and services seems only to be accelerating, a prospect even sweeter than one of Ted Lasso&rsquo;s famous biscuits.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/technology/daniel-kaminsky-dead.html">Nicole Perlroth</a> (via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26925044">Hacker News</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/technology/daniel-kaminsky-dead.html"><p>He was a respected practitioner of &ldquo;penetration testing,&rdquo; the business of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to harden their systems from attack. [&#8230;] When Daniel was 11, his mother said, she received an angry phone call from someone who identified himself as a network administrator for the Western United States. [&#8230;] Without her knowledge, Daniel had been examining military websites. The administrator vowed to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; him by cutting off the family&rsquo;s internet access. Mrs. Maurer warned the administrator that if he made good on his threat, she would take out an advertisement in The San Francisco Chronicle denouncing the Pentagon&rsquo;s security.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>In 2005, after researchers discovered Sony BMG was covertly installing software on PCs to combat music piracy, Sony executives played down the move. Mr. Kaminsky forced the issue into public awareness after discovering that Sony&rsquo;s software had infected more than 568,000 computers.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky"><p>In 2008, Kaminsky discovered a fundamental flaw in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" title="Malware">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) protocol that could allow attackers to easily perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_poisoning" title="Cache poisoning">cache poisoning</a> attacks on most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameserver" title="">nameservers</a>[&#8230;]. With most Internet-based applications depending on DNS to locate their peers, a wide range of attacks became feasible, including website impersonation, email interception, and authentication bypass via the &ldquo;Forgot My Password&rdquo; feature on many popular websites. After discovering the problem, Kaminsky initially contacted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie" title="Paul Vixie">Paul Vixie</a>, who described the severity of the issue as meaning &ldquo;everything in the digital universe was going to have to get patched.&rdquo; Kaminsky then alerted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security" title="Department of Homeland Security">Department of Homeland Security</a> and executives at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco" title="Cisco">Cisco</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> to work on a fix.</p><p>Kaminsky worked with DNS vendors in secret to develop a patch to make exploiting the vulnerability more difficult, releasing it on July 8, 2008. To date, the DNS design flaw vulnerability has not been fully fixed.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>The actual vulnerability was related to DNS only having 65,536 possible transaction IDs, a number small enough to simply guess given enough opportunities. Dan Bernstein, author of djbdns, had reported this as early as 1999. djbdns dealt with the issue using Source Port Randomization, in which the UDP port was used as a second transaction identifier, thus raising the possible ID count into the billions. [&#8230;] Kaminsky&rsquo;s attack bypassed this TTL defense by targeting &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; names like &ldquo;83.example.com&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;www.example.com&rdquo; directly. Because the name was unique, it had no entry in the cache, and thus no TTL. But because the name was a sibling, the transaction-ID guessing spoofed response could not only include information for itself, but for the target as well.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

generic types easier to work with in Swift, and <em>five</em> years since the first
version of the Swift <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/GenericsManifesto.md">Generics Manifesto</a>. (Time flies when you&rsquo;re
building a language!) Last week, generics landed back in the spotlight, as
Anthony Latsis, Filip Sakel, and Suyash Srijan proposed <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0309-unlock-existential-types-for-all-protocols.md">SE-0309</a>, with
a major change that addresses one of the most infamous errors in Swift:</p><blockquote><p>Protocol can only be used as a generic constraint because it has &lsquo;Self&rsquo; or
associated type requirements.</p></blockquote><p>While this change is still in review (through May 1), it looks very promising &mdash;
but, as often happens when dealing with the corners of the type system, the
details can be a bit opaque. Much like <a href="/blog/2019/04/14/swift-generics-evolution/">last time</a>, this post
will walk through the nitty-gritty of the proposed changes in SE-0309, and offer
some practical scenarios where they might improve day-to-day Swift usage.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.mightyapp.com/mightys-secret-plan-to-invent-the-future-of-computing/">Suhail Doshi</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1387063023521595394">tweet</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26957215">Hacker News</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="https://blog.mightyapp.com/mightys-secret-plan-to-invent-the-future-of-computing/"><p>We&rsquo;re excited to finally unveil <a href="https://mightyapp.com">Mighty</a>, a faster browser that is entirely streamed from a powerful computer in the cloud.</p><p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/suhail/status/1112970313329852418?lang=en">2 years of hard work</a>, we&rsquo;ve created something that&rsquo;s indistinguishable from a Google Chrome that runs at 4K, 60 frames a second, takes no more than 500 MB of RAM, and often less than 30% CPU with 50+ tabs open. This is the first step in making a new kind of computer.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>One answer is moving more client-side compute to the cloud. [&#8230;] If you can move the most demanding processing, then battery life can finally improve because video decode and render times (we&rsquo;re streaming video here) get more efficient with better chipsets. [&#8230;] If most of the time people spend is in a browser and most of the processing and system resources are offloaded, their computer won&rsquo;t feel slow as apps become more demanding.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds like an amazing technical achievement, if it works as described, yet also an <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1387094702139142145">indictment</a> of the modern hardware/software stack. Personally, I mostly work in native apps and don&rsquo;t find the Web unacceptably slow, certainly not to the point of wanting to <a href="https://twitter.com/MidnightSun_55/status/1387132265054998534">rent</a> a VM in the cloud or give a company <a href="https://twitter.com/0___x_0/status/1387094703640743937">all my data</a>.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1388714552754249729">
<p>Anyone who asks &ldquo;why would anyone need Mighty?&rdquo; has their critique backwards. It should be: how is it that Mighty is a compelling value prop? How is performance of native apps a non-issue on a $600 iPad, but we&rsquo;re moving mountains to make web apps bearable on high-end hardware?</p>
<p>Traditionally, the strategy for a disruptive platform that has a built-in disadvantage (in this case performance) is to attack new or neglected markets. The web however has repeatedly insisted on focusing on areas that highlight its weaknesses, while seldom offering anything new.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>@Suhail is right, the web of  2021 isn&rsquo;t for reading blogs. You know how I know this? Because when I go to a medium.com link, it bounces me into to Medium iOS app. Because not only have we failed to offer the the future, we somehow managed to <em>lose ground</em> too.</p>
<p>The web lost mobile, full stop. And yet I&rsquo;m still seeing pitches for how &ldquo;the future of the Desktop is the web&rdquo; like it&rsquo;s JSConf 2009.</p>

<p>This was slow enough that in a few cases I had worked around it by using an extension to introduce an instance method to do the test.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-4-released/">
<p>The Swift compiler is much better at tracking dependencies between files, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of files compiled for many kinds of changes during incremental builds</p>
<p>Dependencies on member variables and functions of structs, enums, classes, and protocols are now tracked individually by the Swift compiler. This finer granularity speeds and shrinks rebuilds after changes to these entities</p></blockquote>
<p>There are code completion and type checking improvements, too.</p>

<p>In the following months, I used Siri to play a variety of music and podcast content in Spotify without ever appending the &ldquo;in Spotify&rdquo; qualifier to my requests, and Siri never asked me to pick a different audio player again. By all intents and purposes, this option had the effect of setting a default audio player for Siri on my device.</p>
<p>Apple, however, recently stressed how this new Siri feature in iOS 14.5 shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as &ldquo;changing a default app&rdquo;, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apple is continuing to expand Shortcuts with new actions and system integrations in iOS 14.5.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s &lsquo;Take Screenshot&rsquo;. As the name implies, you can use this action to programmatically capture a screenshot of whatever is in the foreground when the shortcut runs without having to press the Power + Volume Up buttons.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>You can now also control your device&rsquo;s orientation lock settings via the &lsquo;Set Orientation Lock&rsquo; action. With this action, you can either toggle orientation lock, or you can use parameters to specifically set it to &lsquo;on&rsquo; or &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly though, this action is the perfect candidate for an automation that disables orientation lock whenever you open video apps like YouTube and Netflix.</p></blockquote>

<p>I keep orientation lock on at all times but now, when I launch Halide, orientation lock toggles off, and then switches itself back on when I leave the app. This does seem like something Apple could provide an API to developers for &mdash; the Camera app is able to rotate its UI and the photos it takes without toggling orientation lock &mdash; but it is an excellent workaround.</p>

<p>I wish this were a standard per-app preference, like with notifications, cellular, and location access.</p>

<p>Just letting me set a delay for requiring a passcode would offer a much better user experience. I&rsquo;ve been using Guided Access, which is a pain to turn on and off, doesn&rsquo;t work with Apple Pay, and doesn&rsquo;t let me switch to another app.</p>

<p>At last Apple has returned to providing extensive release notes to accompany the Big Sur 11.3 update. Because they&rsquo;re so long and detailed, I won&rsquo;t attempt to summarise them, but recommend that you read them[&#8230;]</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s what we all really wanted. The largest macOS update ever, a good gigabyte bigger than even the Catalina 10.15.1 update, and more than most major releases of Mac OS X, the Big Sur 11.3 update gives us what we&rsquo;ve all been asking for: it fixes a lot of bugs. The trouble with getting what you want are the unintended consequences.</p>
<p>For a few, the 11.3 update has proved disastrous, with a clean re-install their only hope of salvation. For most of us, its sheer size has at least been compensated for by the relative brevity of updating. But for those who are more cautious and don&rsquo;t rush to update, it poses a serious problem: buried in its avalanche of fixes and improvements is one to address a serious security vulnerability, which makes updating an urgent need.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Using the popular strategy of waiting a few weeks after each update before installing it yourself now turns into a quandary. Is it better to run the risk of updating now, or that of malware making your Mac a victim?</p>
<p>One solution could be for Apple to start releasing Big Sur updates in two streams: security updates only, and full updates.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve seen a chorus of pundits, both professional and armchair (hi), push two theories that are either at odds or entwined, depending on how you look at them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surely, a dystopian iOS-like future of only sanctioned App Store purchases lies ahead for the Mac. (Let&rsquo;s call this the &ldquo;Hacker News bait&rdquo; narrative.)</li>
<li>Surely, the iPad is going to catch up or even surpass the Mac&mdash;it already does so many things so well, and it&rsquo;s only held back from its potential by an OS with artificial limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>As long as this philosophy on Apple&rsquo;s part holds&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no evidence that it&rsquo;s changing&mdash;macOS will never be locked down to the degree iOS is, i.e., unable to install non-App Store apps without jailbreaking.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>But that brings us to the second point. Is this the year when the iPad <em>does</em> get to do everything, not just most things, the Mac does? Will we be able to run macOS apps on M1 iPad Pros the way we can run iOS apps on M1 Macs?</p>

It&rsquo;s running iPadOS, is optimized for touch and has apps in different screens. Now imagine connecting that iPad to a 6K display. Full screen apps are absurd on such a large screen. Instead, imagine apps running on the iPad are now mirrored in macOS as separate windows, which can still be optionally full screened. The screen on the iPad is still in iPadOS, and you can even use touch or the Apple Pencil. Input from either interface updates the other in real time.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really would just like Apple&rsquo;s next iPad Pro to be a laptop. Not a clamshell, but a Surface Pro type of deal: a tablet with laptop hardware and a laptop OS.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>But now that the iPad Pro is an M1 system, I don&rsquo;t see why it <em>can&rsquo;t</em> run macOS apps. Because it has the same hardware as the MacBook Air (including the fanless form factor). So the iPad really should be able to run whatever the MacBook Air can run.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The result of all this is that we&rsquo;re moving toward a weird point in the evolution of these two devices where the MacBook can do everything the iPad can do (but it doesn&rsquo;t have the touchscreen hardware to take advantage of all of it), while the iPad can still only do iPad things (even though features of macOS would take good advantage of its touchscreen capability). It seems like a point where Apple&rsquo;s goals of &ldquo;creating a seamless ecosystem&rdquo; and &ldquo;selling you many different products&rdquo; are starting to butt heads.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/ipad-mac-not-merging/"><p>An iPad that runs MacOS would suck just as much &mdash; albeit for different reasons &mdash; as a Mac that ran iPadOS. But now that they are all on the same silicon, it makes the ways in which the iPad is limited by its software that much more noticeable. Griffin points out that Apple demoed Final Cut Pro on a Pro Display XDR to show how powerful the M1 is in a Mac, but could not do any of that with an iPad because the software does not exist. He even tries to coax Joz into admitting that Apple is working on professional apps for the iPad, with predictably little success.</p>

<p>If you toggle between a few resource-hungry apps on a Mac and then go back to Safari, it picks up where you left off; if you open the camera and a few other apps on an iPad and then switch back to Safari, your open tabs might reload. If you pause the music you are listening to so you can watch something in your browser, then try to resume playback, it is a crapshoot whether it resumes correctly, starts the song again, or entirely forgets that you were listening to music &mdash; and it is <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/airplay-frustrations/">worse with AirPlay</a>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/interview-apple-executives-on-the-2021-ipad-pro-stunting-with-the-m1-and-creating-headroom/">
<p>One of the stronger answers on the &lsquo;why the aggressive spec bump&rsquo; question comes later in our discussion but is worth mentioning in this context. The point, Joswiak says, is to offer headroom. Headroom for users and headroom for developers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the things that iPad Pro has done as John [Ternus] has talked about is push the envelope. And by pushing the envelope that has created this space for developers to come in and fill it. When we created the very first iPad Pro, there was no Photoshop,&rdquo; Joswiak notes. &ldquo;There was no creative apps that could immediately use it. But now there&rsquo;s so many you can&rsquo;t count. Because we created that capability, we created that performance &mdash; and, by the way sold a fairly massive number of them &mdash; which is a pretty good combination for developers to then come in and say, I can take advantage of that. There&rsquo;s enough customers here and there&rsquo;s enough performance. I know how to use that. And that&rsquo;s the same thing we do with each generation. We create more headroom to performance that developers will figure out how to use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The customer is in a great spot because they know they&rsquo;re buying something that&rsquo;s got some headroom and developers love it.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote cite="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/ipad-pro-headroom/">
<p>I buy this argument, particularly as the iPad is the kind of product that should last years. Since the first-generation iPad Pro, iPads have seemed to be built for software and workflows that are two or three years down the road. But the question about the iPad for about that same length of time is less <em>can you?</em> and more <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/ipad-mac-not-merging/"><em>would you want to?</em></a>, and I hope the answer to that comes sooner than a few years out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9324">Riccardo Mori</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://morrick.me/archives/9324">
<p>I kind of buy that argument too, in the sense that it&rsquo;s the only possible argument Apple can elaborate at this point. But this headroom Joswiak and Ternus are talking about is getting so ridiculously high that I truly wonder whether the whole thing is starting to lose sense.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Apologies if I&rsquo;m getting unbearably pedantic here, but I do think that Apple&rsquo;s narrative here is like <em>You know, the chicken did indeed come before the egg</em>, while I&rsquo;m rather certain the opposite is true. Creative apps and iOS developers never really waited for Apple; I&rsquo;ve purchased creative apps for iOS since 2008, and what I&rsquo;ve noticed is that developers in general, and especially developers of creative apps, have always tried to stay ahead of the curve. And all the iPads I&rsquo;ve handled in the past ten years have never really struggled when running such creative apps.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, an M1 iPad Pro is essentially a Mac with a touch interface. Software-wise, this incredibly powerful iPad is as capable as a 2014 iPad Air 2 (the oldest iPad model that can run iPadOS 14). There is still, in my opinion, a substantial <em>software design</em> gap preventing iPads from being as flexible as they are powerful. Software-wise, iPadOS still lacks <em>flow</em>.</p>
