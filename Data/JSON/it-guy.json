  "description": "MTJC podcast is a show about mobile development. Each week Jaime Lopez, Mark Rubin (sometimes Greg Heo and Tammy Coron) and myself, Tim Mitra, will convene from across the continent to discuss iOS and Mac development. We discuss current issues to find out what developers are talking about, what their apps are about, what they are using to create their apps and what advice they have for other developers (or those looking to become one). We also have news, notes and tech tips for developers.",

The HomePod will be delayed until the new year. Fact Check: Face ID does learn from its mistakes, also you need to focus on it sometimes. Tim shares some experiences updating apps for the iPhone X. The iPhone SE may get updated in the new year. We ponder that Swift code will run on Google&#39;s Fuchsia OS. iOS 11.2 will allow introductory subscription pricing. We discuss the issues around Net Neutrality as the FCC votes on it. We discuss Uber&#39;s attempt to cover up a major hack where 57 million user accounts are stolen. Coding can be done at the same time with Atom&#39;s Teletype and Visual Studio&#39;s Live Share.

      "summary": "We begin our US Thanksgiving Episode looking into the iPhone's density from our #askMTJC as well as Reachability. iOS 11 has some layout bugs. The HomePod will be delayed until the new year. Fact Check: Face ID does learn from its mistakes, also you need to focus on it sometimes. Tim shares some experiences updating apps for the iPhone X. The iPhone SE may get updated in the new year. We ponder that Swift code will run on Google's Fuchsia OS. iOS 11.2 will allow introductory subscription pricing. We discuss the issues around Net Neutrality as the FCC votes on it. We discuss Uber's attempt to cover up a major hack where 57 million user accounts are stolen. Coding can be done at the same time with Atom's Teletype and Visual Studio's Live Share.

      "summary": "NB: we had no control over the recording process. The audio is not great. So we've decided to unpublished the episode. The episode will remain here on the web site for those who are interested.\nWe recorded LIVE at 360|iDev 2017 with Tammy Coron, Joe Cieplinski and Jean MacDonald. We discussed MacID in #askMTJC. We also followed up on Rubber Duck debugging and Chris Lattner's move to Google. New in 10.3 is a new certificate trust setting in iOS. We chat with the panel about highlights of the 360|iDev conference and the things coming from Apple: a new iPhone, Apple Watch LTE and Home Pod. Jean also illuminated App Camp for Girls and her new podcast SestraCast. Picks: Lavar Burton Reads,Toothfairy, Bartender, Red Hot Timer and Forest.
